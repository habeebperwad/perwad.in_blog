Yvette Chauviré, one of the 20th century’s outstanding ballerinas and the most lustrous star of French ballet from the 1940s through the 1960s, died on Wednesday at her home in Paris. She was 99.The Paris Opera announced her death.Originally a child prodigy at the Paris Opera Ballet, Ms. Chauviré (pronounced shaw-vih-RAY) was acclaimed as a national symbol of French culture by an adoring public and by the French government, which bestowed its highest honors on her.Although she belonged to a generation of gifted ballerinas at the Paris Opera, she was set apart by a mesmerizing elegance that was never confused with chic. Critics at home and abroad defined her dancing as “velvet and steel,” a warm lyricism coating a virtuoso technique and perfect classical form.Early in her career, in the 1930s and ’40s, she was identified mainly with experimental works by Serge Lifar, the controversial director of the Paris Opera Ballet whose choreography dominated its repertoire. Yet she also made the 19th-century classic “Giselle,” in which she danced the title role, her signature piece.In 1988, when the Paris Opera Ballet presented a gala in New York in honor of Rudolf Nureyev, its director at the time, he took his curtain call at the Metropolitan Opera House flanked by two carefully chosen ballerinas: Margot Fonteyn and Yvette Chauviré.Fonteyn was his longtime partner in Britain’s Royal Ballet. Ms. Chauviré was the idol he admired from afar.After his defection from the Soviet Union in Paris in 1961, he asked if he could partner her in a scheduled appearance at the Paris Opera. The French government, however, bowed to Soviet protests and canceled the performance.Undeterred, Ms. Chauviré often danced with Nureyev in Paris and London and on tour later in the 1960s, with especially memorable performances as a tender Giselle opposite Nureyev as her Albrecht, the nobleman who betrays the peasant heroine.Ms. Chauviré had achieved another form of international fame at 20 when she acted in “La Mort du Cygne” (“The Death of the Swan”), Jean Benoît-Lévy’s haunting 1937 feature film about backstage ballet intrigue. (It was released in the United States in 1938 as “Ballerina.”) Her youthful beauty and the depth of her acting stunned a new generation of Americans when the film was rediscovered and screened in New York in 1998. Ms. Chauviré was on hand to discuss it.Ms. Chauviré studied at the Paris Opera Ballet’s school, and for that reason she was often regarded as a product of specifically French training. Yet her performing career was actually molded by Russian influences.One was Lifar himself. A former star of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, he was the Paris company’s director, star dancer and choreographer from 1930 to 1945 and also choreographer in the 1950s. It was Lifar who encouraged Ms. Chauviré to retrain herself with two Russian émigré teachers, Victor Gsovsky and especially Boris Kniaseff, who softened the academic side of her schooling, gave her an elongated line and developed the lyricism that distinguished her style.In Ms. Chauviré’s view, the Paris Opera school was more Italian than French because of its Italian teachers. As she told her biographer, Gérard Mannoni, the inheritors of the true French style — transferred to St. Petersburg by French choreographers — were the Russians. “Serge Lifar would show us all the difference,” she said.Yvette Chauviré was born in Paris on April 22, 1917, and entered the Paris Opera Ballet school in 1927. She was 13 when she joined the opera’s ballet company in 1931. At 12, she had already come to notice in “L’Eventail de Jeanne” (“Jeanne’s Fan”), a children’s ballet that earned a lasting place in 20th-century music because of its score by 10 avant-garde French composers, including Ravel and Poulenc.Rising rapidly to principal dancer in 1937, Ms. Chauviré was named to the highest rank, étoile, in 1941, right after she astonished audiences with an 18-minute solo as a fertility goddess in Lifar’s “Istar.”She was one of three ballerinas seen regularly in Lifar’s premieres; the others were Solange Schwarz and Lycette Darsonval. In 1943, all three led his “Suite en Blanc,” a pioneering work in the plotless neo-Classical genre being developed at the same time by George Balanchine in New York. The third Lifar ballet always associated with her was “Les Mirages,” an allegorical fantasy in which she was the Shadow, or conscience, of a questing hero.“Les Mirages” had its premiere in 1947 — the year Ms. Chauviré and Lifar returned to the company after leaving it, for different reasons, after World War II. Lifar had been accused of collaborating with the Germans and was ousted from the Paris Opera in 1945. Ms. Chauviré left voluntarily in 1946 to join Lifar in another company, the Nouveau Ballet de Monte-Carlo, where he created three ballets for her.Ms. Chauviré’s loyalty to her mentor was evident in her departure from the Paris Opera Ballet, but she also knew that the company was by then bereft of a resident choreographer. Future young stars like Roland Petit and Jean Babilée also left for the Nouveau Ballet before forming new troupes.The Paris Opera administration tried to fill a creative gap by inviting guest choreographers, including Balanchine for eight months. The dancers, however, petitioned for Lifar, and he was called back, initially as a choreographer.With postwar passions still running high, Lifar’s partial reinstatement provoked protests. In one episode right after his return, the dancers were already in costume when stagehands blocked their performance by refusing to raise the fire curtain onstage.In response, Ms. Chauviré, in a tiara and tutu, led the dancers — 90 in all — down the opera house’s interior grand staircase.Lifar’s presence also drew protests when pickets gathered outside City Center during the Paris Opera Ballet’s New York debut in 1948. Ms. Chauviré, an audience favorite, took Lifar by the hand one evening and thrust him forward for a curtain call.Ms. Chauviré, in the meantime, began to explore other opportunities. She appeared as a guest with Petit’s Ballets des Champs-Élysées, where Gsovsky, her former teacher, choreographed a highly difficult showpiece for her, “Grand Pas Classique,” with which she later toured the world.The guest appearance led the Paris Opera to suspend her in a contract dispute over her desire to freelance, and in 1949 she left the company for the second time. But she returned in 1953, when a new administration gave her a more flexible contract permitting her to make guest appearances elsewhere. She went on to perform with major companies in Europe, the United States, South Africa and Latin America.With expanded opportunities, she extended her range to full-length 19th-Russian classics, including “The Sleeping Beauty” and “The Nutcracker,” then absent from the Paris Opera repertoire.She retired as a member of the company in 1956 but continued to appear with it as a guest, both at home and abroad, until her farewell performance at the Paris Opera in 1972 (although she appeared in mime roles with Nureyev after he became its artistic director in 1983).She also choreographed short ballets with stage designs by her husband, the Russian émigré artist Constantin Nepo. He died in 1976. No immediate family members survive.Ms. Chauviré was co-director of the Paris Opera Ballet school for a few years in the 1960s.Throughout her career her heart remained with “Giselle,” created at the Paris Opera in 1841. She often worked on it alone, without music. As she wrote in her memoir, “Autobiographie,” she continually sought to deepen her interpretation of her signature role.One insight was about Giselle’s famed mad scene in Act I. It was not about conventional madness, Ms. Chauviré concluded. When Giselle realizes Albrecht has lied to her, she wrote, “she suddenly ages, she plunges into another world.”“It’s not really madness,” she went on. “She is submerged in an ocean of bizarre feelings.”
