Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, who in a life of varied artistic careers, most notably as a commentator on NPR, was best known for extolling the virtues of the Gullah food and culture of her native South Carolina, died on Saturday in the Bronx. She was 79.The death was announced by NPR. Ms. Smart-Grosvenor (pronounced GROVE-nor) had an aneurysm in 2009, which effectively ended her broadcasting career. She died in the Hebrew Home at Riverdale.Ms. Smart-Grosvenor, who liked to call herself a “culinary griot,” was heard on NPR for three decades, starting in 1980. She treated listeners to hundreds of reports, primarily on food, culture and travel but on social issues as well. Her first major credential as a culinary anthropologist was her book “Vibration Cooking or, The Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl” (1970), often described as an autobiographical cookbook.“When I cook, I never measure or weigh anything; I cook by vibration,” she wrote, by way of explaining the title. “I can tell by the look and smell of it.” She did acknowledge, however, in a Black History Month television interview in 1984, that there was at least one exception: “One cup of rice. Two cups of water. You’ve got to get that right.”The book’s title also used the adjective Geechee, rather than Gullah, for the West African-influenced language and culture of parts of low-country South Carolina and Georgia and their islands. That term was long considered a pejorative among both blacks and whites, but she proudly reclaimed it. She took the same approach with the cooking traditions that enslaved Africans had carried with them to Southern shores.Ms. Smart-Grosvenor was also an actress, appearing in the films “Daughters of the Dust” (1991), Julie Dash’s tale of three generations of Gullah women, and “Beloved” (1998), the Civil War-era drama based on Toni Morrison’s novel. In her youth, Ms. Smart even acted on Broadway. She appeared with Franchot Tone and Dennis Hopper in “Mandingo,” a play set on an Alabama plantation, which ran only eight performances in 1961 at the Lyceum Theater.After that, she became a backup singer for Sun Ra’s avant-garde music collective, the Solar-Myth Arkestra, and in her spare time designed (and sometimes even sewed) the group’s bold costumes.Ms. Smart-Grosvenor is the subject of a coming documentary, “Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl,” directed by Ms. Dash and expected in theaters in 2017. The film will include some re-enactments, Ms. Dash said, because “she was a dramatic person.”Vertamae Smart was born on April 4, 1937, in Fairfax, S.C. Her only sibling, a twin brother, died in infancy. When she was around 10, she moved with her parents to Philadelphia.In her new city, she was ridiculed for the low-country way she spoke, her height (six feet) and her family’s dinner-table choices. She soon realized that “Americans eat cornflakes, Campbell’s soup, mashed potatoes,” Ms. Smart-Grosvenor recalled in an oral history interview for Tulane University in 1992. “We ate rice.”Growing up, she read about and became fascinated by the Beat Generation’s bohemian lives and Josephine Baker’s success in Paris. At 19, inspired and encouraged, Ms. Smart moved to Paris, having saved enough money from her job as a department store shipping clerk to sail there alone.She found her tribe at a modest Left Bank residence nicknamed the Beat Hotel: a group of expatriate writers and artists, including Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs. One of them, the New York-born sculptor Robert Grosvenor, became her husband.In a 1986 radio commentary, Ms. Smart-Grosvenor remembered her arrival. “As I walked down the Boulevard Saint-Germain, I thought, ‘I can’t paint, I can’t write, and I can’t sing and dance like La Baker, but something great and wonderful is gonna happen to me.’ The myth of Europe made me believe in the possibilities.”Jessica B. Harris, author of “High on the Hog: A Culinary Journey From Africa to America,” has an explanation for the young Ms. Smart’s success. “Vertamae was a connector,” Ms. Harris said in an interview on Monday. “She made a way out of no way. She created this extraordinary legacy out of whole cloth — with probably not a lot of help.”In a 1981 interview with The New York Times, Ms. Smart-Grosvenor recounted another Parisian experience, her exhausting but ultimately successful search in 1959 for the ingredients for a proper down-home New Year’s meal: black-eyed peas (essential for good luck), yams, ham hocks and something similar to collard greens. “The cornbread was no problem,” she remembered. “Even the French sold cornmeal.”Returning to the United States, where she lived in New York and Washington, she continued to explore her talents, doing improvisational acting in Tompkins Square Park. And she built a circle of notable acquaintances. Friends recalled arriving at dinner parties and finding the likes of James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka and Nikki Giovanni among the guests.According to Ms. Dash, the Grosvenors’ first dinner party after returning to New York was for a young Japanese artist whom Ms. Smart-Grosvenor found “very sweet and shy.” That guest was Yoko Ono, years before she met John Lennon.In addition to appearing frequently on the NPR series “All Things Considered,” Ms. Smart-Grosvenor hosted “Seasonings,” a series of NPR cooking specials, and was briefly the host of “The Americas’ Family Kitchen With Vertamae Grosvenor” on public television in the 1990s.In recent years, she had lived in Palm Key, S.C., a private island just one county away from her birthplace. Her survivors include two daughters, Chandra Weinland Brown, whose father is Oscar Weinland, a sculptor and visual artist, and Kali Grosvenor-Henry; and two grandchildren.In a 1988 interview with The Times, for an article that included her recipe for Frogmore stew (a k a, a low-country shrimp boil), she reiterated her lifelong passion for cooking. “Whatever goes into your mouth,” she observed, “should be something that has been thought about.”Then she offered perhaps the ultimate example of its primacy. “You can’t have a proper funeral without food,” she said. “When someone dies, the food, the spread, the feast has to be right so people will say, ‘She had a proper send-off.’”
