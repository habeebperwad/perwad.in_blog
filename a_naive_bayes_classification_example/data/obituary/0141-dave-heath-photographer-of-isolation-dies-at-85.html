Dave Heath, a photographer whose images expressing his sense of urban isolation and a yearning for personal connection won a fervent group of admirers despite his many years of public obscurity, died on Monday, his 85th birthday, in Toronto.Cara Heitmann, a friend of more than 25 years and executor of his will, said he had fallen at his home in Toronto and died in a hospital there.Although his lustrous black-and-white prints owed a lot to the bleaching techniques of W. Eugene Smith, and though his poetic images of people glimpsed in streets and public parks sounded some of the same broken chords as those struck by his friend Robert Frank in his book “The Americans,” Mr. Heath was in many ways a school of one.His photographs, notably collected in his signature work, the 1965 book “A Dialogue With Solitude,” reflected his own troubled experience.Born on June 27, 1931, but quickly abandoned by his parents, David Heath (he was named David after a maternal great-grandfather, a rabbi in Russia) was raised in an orphanage and a series of foster homes in Philadelphia.His discovery of photography as a teenager was his salvation.“I don’t know why some people become artists and others don’t,” he told an interviewer in the 1980s, “but there was some deeper sense within myself of survival, of having to define and declare myself on my own terms and not in other people’s terms.”Mr. Heath largely taught himself, hunting for pictures in downtown Philadelphia or taking his 35-millimeter camera aboard buses. The photo essays of Smith and other contributors to Life magazine were early inspirations.Drafted into the Army in 1952, he was trained as a machine-gunner in Korea during the war there but managed to take numerous portraits of his fellow soldiers. Full of restless ambition on his return from service, he spent two frustrating semesters at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, tried to launch his career as an artist in Chicago, and then moved to New York City on Jan. 1, 1955.Success soon followed. His portraits were highly regarded by other photographers in the downtown coffeehouse scene and by curators. By the early 1960s he had exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago and the George Eastman House (today the George Eastman Museum) in Rochester.In 1963 and 1964 he was awarded successive Guggenheim fellowships, which gave him the freedom to do more photography and to tinker with the editing and sequencing of the book “A Dialogue With Solitude.” He stretched this process out to more than two years.The book is a suite of 82 photos arranged in 10 chapters, on themes of anarchy, violence, love, childhood, old age, poverty, war, race, youth and death. Each section is preceded by an epigraph from a literary figure: W. B. Yeats, Hermann Hesse, Rainer Maria Rilke, Robert Louis Stevenson, Matthew Arnold, Stephen Crane, James Baldwin, William Hazlitt, Wright Morris and T. S. Eliot.Together, photos and texts cast a crepuscular mood that Robert Frank, in an opening essay, described as “late Friday afternoon in the Universe.”The book communicates Mr. Heath’s alienated but tender view of humanity. The poor and lonely, of many ages and races, predominate in his world.In one layout he pairs portraits of a young dark-haired woman intensely reading a copy of Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” in a New York cafe with that of a downcast, pockmarked G. I. in Korea. Two adult men in a fistfight on a crowded street are next to an image of one adolescent boy raising his fist to hit another.There were strikingly simple and mysterious images as well, such as the dirty white circular bowl of a public drinking fountain holding two leaves.The 1965 edition quickly went out of print — as did a 2000 reissue — and by the end of the ‘60s the earnest emotionalism of Mr. Heath’s photography was out of style. In 1970 he accepted a teaching job at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University) in Toronto, and Canada became his home.Thereafter he often relied on a Polaroid SX-70 camera to document his surroundings, sandwiching the prints in thick notebooks dense with personal writing. He produced these journals for more than three decades.For many years his artistic standing remained higher in Canada than in the United States. In 1981 the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa gave him a retrospective. But he regained visibility in the United States in the late 1980s, when the Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York began mounting regular shows of his vintage black-and-white prints and helped a private press to publish his portraits from Korea.Finally, in 2015, Mr. Heath was given a retrospective in his native country. “Multitude, Solitude: The Photographs of Dave Heath,” opened at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and traveled to the Nelson-Atkins Art Museum in Kansas City, Mo. Its curator of photography, Keith F. Davis, was a longtime supporter and organized the show.The show delved into the origins of “A Dialogue With Solitude,” displaying spreads of the 1965 maquette and several handmade photo-books from the 1950s. A selection of his street portraits in color, taken with a digital camera from 2001 to 2007, demonstrated the continuity of his preoccupations over 50 years.One of these was a desire to experiment with the rhythms of his photos on the page and even on the wall. One room in Philadelphia recreated a 1969 slide show, “Beyond the Gates of Eden,” in which a pair of projectors flashed images of his work to the recorded accompaniment of Mr. Heath reading a William Everson poem and of Tim Buckley singing his 1967 song “Pleasant Street,” with its psychedelic lyrics (“All the stony people/walking around in Christian licorice clothes”). Mr. Heath did five of these slide-tape programs between 1969 and 1982, none of them alike.“The central motif of Dave Heath’s life has been a dark and pervasive feeling of rejection,” Mr. Davis wrote in the exhibition’s catalog. “His sense of emotional homelessness was at once a great weight and a motivation — a source of personal pain and of deep philosophical insight.”A shy and unpredictable man who did not find it easy to socialize and whose only marriage, to Angelika de Kornfeld, was short-lived, Mr. Heath surprised his hosts when he came to Philadelphia for opening night and gave a public talk the next day about his work.“He was in great spirits and both amazed and grateful for all the good feeling and warm comments,” Mr. Davis reported in an email.Mr. Heath has no immediate survivors. But last year he was contacted by two first cousins he didn’t know he had, Bonnie Feinberg and Wendy Soslow, both from Pennsylvania. They were going to meet Mr. Heath for the first time next week.
