Tony Conrad, an experimental filmmaker, avant-garde musician and university educator who in the 1960s was a central figure in a flowering Lower Manhattan art movement, died on Saturday at a hospice in Cheektowaga, N.Y., near Buffalo. He was 76.Mr. Conrad’s gallerist, Carol Greene of the Greene Naftali gallery in Manhattan, confirmed his death. She said he had been treated for prostate cancer.Mr. Conrad was relentless and rigorous in expanding the parameters of the fields in which he worked. His early musical compositions, like “Four Violins” (1964), were high-volume sustained drones. His first film, “The Flicker” (1966), created a pulsating stroboscopic effect with alternating black and white frames. It was preceded by a stern warning that the film could induce epileptic seizures in certain spectators and that audience members remained in the theater at their own risk.Less assaultive but even harder to watch was Mr. Conrad’s “Yellow Movie” (1973) series, canvases painted with black-bordered white screens that, over time, would eventually turn yellow.Reached by email, Branden W. Joseph, the author of “Beyond the Dream Syndicate: Tony Conrad and the Arts After Cage” (2008), called Mr. Conrad “an integral part of the ‘secret history’ of the ’60s,” citing his influence on art forms “from camp cinema to structural film to minimal music to experimental rock ’n’ roll to video art and more.”Upon moving to New York after graduating from Harvard in the early 1960s, Mr. Conrad became a catalytic figure in the Lower East Side art scene. He performed as a violinist with the composer La Monte Young’s Theater of Eternal Music, also known as the Dream Syndicate. He assembled the soundtrack for Jack Smith’s underground movie “Flaming Creatures” (in which he also appeared). And, along with John Cale, a fellow member of the Dream Syndicate, he provided backup for a band called the Primitives, which featured Lou Reed on vocals.Mr. Reed and Mr. Cale went on to found the band the Velvet Underground, and though Mr. Conrad was never a member of it, he did contribute to it inadvertently: The group’s name was taken from the title of a lurid paperback on popular sexology that Mr. Conrad had found on the street and left in the Ludlow Street apartment he shared with Mr. Cale.Anthony Schmaltz Conrad was born on March 7, 1940, in Concord, N.H., the first child of Arthur Emil Conrad and the former Mary Elizabeth Parfitt. His father was a painter, whose portrait of Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina hangs in the United States Senate reception room.Mr. Conrad grew up in Baltimore and Northern Virginia. At Harvard he majored in mathematics and was exposed to the radically unconventional musical ideas of John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, both of whom lectured in Cambridge, Mass.After his graduation in 1962, Mr. Conrad briefly worked as a computer programmer and immersed himself in New York’s experimental music scene. As part of Mr. Young’s ensemble, he performed seemingly improvisational pieces that involved holding notes for what might have felt like hours at a time. Some audiences found the music maddening; others were exalted.“It appeared as if Schoenberg had destroyed music,” Mr. Conrad said in an interview with The Guardian in March, referring to the revolutionary Austrian composer. “Then it appeared as if Cage had destroyed Schoenberg. Our project was to destroy Cage.”Mr. Conrad considered “The Flicker,” accompanied by a soundtrack of what he called “homemade electronic music,” to be an extension of ideas that he shared with Mr. Young. In a 1966 interview with the Village Voice critic Jonas Mekas, Mr. Conrad explained that he “was working within a form of light that is broken down not into areas or into colors but into frequencies.”As austere as it was, “The Flicker” had the power to cause viewers to see color patterns, and even to induce hallucinations. Although there were some who did not consider “The Flicker” to be a film at all, it was included at the 1966 New York Film Festival. A photograph of a festival audience watching the film shows most people shielding their eyes or plugging their ears — and one spectator who seems transfixed.In 1970, Anthology Film Archives, a center in New York for the preservation, study and exhibition of film and video, included “The Flicker” on its list of essential works of cinema art.Mr. Conrad went on to make several films with his first wife, Beverly Grant, an Off Off Broadway actress featured in several early Andy Warhol films. He had met her on the set of Jack Smith’s unfinished film “Normal Love,” a homage, begun in 1963, to the movies of Mr. Smith’s childhood. (Mr. Conrad played a character identified as the Mummy; Ms. Grant appeared as the Cobra Woman.)Mr. Conrad’s films with her included “Coming Attractions,” characterized in an advertisement as “the past loves and experiences of an aging transsexual, Francis Francine.” It was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in January 1971. Writing in The New York Times, the critic Roger Greenspun described it as “very funny and very beautiful moment by moment, funky and grand, decadent and vital, demonstrating and justifying a prodigiously complicated technique.”By then, Mr. Conrad was for the most part no longer playing music in public. But, while visiting West Germany with Ms. Grant in 1972, he made what proved to be a highly influential recording, “Outside the Dream Syndicate,” with the German progressive rock band Faust.He began teaching at the University at Buffalo in 1976, joining a media studies faculty that included the avant-garde filmmakers Hollis Frampton and Paul Sharits. Mr. Conrad concentrated on video and video installations and also made movies in Super-8 millimeter.Mr. Conrad and Ms. Grant divorced in 1976, and she died in 1990. His second marriage, to the artist Barbara Broughel, also ended in divorce. Survivors include his third wife, Paige Sarlin, a filmmaker and fellow faculty member at the university; his son, Theodore; and two grandchildren.In the late 1980s, frustrated that Mr. Young had refused to release existing tape recordings of Dream Syndicate performances, Mr. Conrad began recreating some and recording them. He released them on CD, along with vintage tape recordings of Jack Smith and others, in the late 1990s.According to Mr. Joseph, the author, interest in “Outside the Dream Syndicate,” reissued on CD, surged “after the commercial success, overexposure and rapid dilution of grunge rock sent an entire generation of musicians and listeners seeking ‘new blood.’”Mr. Conrad also achieved a new visibility in the art world, collaborating with younger artists like Mike Kelley and Tony Oursler.“Tony Conrad has slowly been emerging from avant-gardist obscurity over the past few years, and about time,” the critic Holland Cotter wrote in The Times on the occasion of Mr. Conrad’s solo show at the 80WSE Gallery in 2012. “His multifold career — as experimental film- and video-maker, composer, musician and sound artist — still looks radical and prescient a half-century after it began.”His last show, “Undone,” was at the Greene Naftali gallery this year.Adopted as an ancestor by both experimental musicians and alt-rockers, Mr. Conrad had been scheduled to appear with Faust at the Big Ears music festival in Knoxville, Tenn., this month.“You don’t know who I am,” Mr. Conrad told The Guardian in what may have been his last interview, “but somehow, indirectly, you’ve been affected by things I did.”
