Benoîte Groult, who became a leading French feminist and writer in the second half of her life, drawing wide attention with a sexually daring novel that explored an unlikely love affair between a Parisian intellectual and an uneducated Breton fisherman, died on Monday in Hyères, in southeastern France. She was 96.Her death was confirmed by her publisher, Éditions Grasset.Ms. Groult’s novel “Les Vaisseaux du Cœur (“Salt on Our Skin”), published in 1988, was branded pornographic in some literary circles because of its vivid depictions of an extramarital affair and female sexuality.The book, set in France in the 1960s, examines the complex emotional dynamics of the couple’s relationship in which their raw desire for each other cannot overcome the wide social divide between them. They each end up marrying someone from a similar background yet they continue their affair for four decades.In 1992 the novel was made into a film, directed by Andrew Birkin and starring Greta Scacchi and Vincent D’Onofrio. It was released in the United States as “Desire.”Some feminists criticized the novel, but many readers viewed the protagonist’s sexual escapades as an expression of a liberated modern woman. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide and was translated into 27 languages.“It’s unacceptable to tell yourself that during 50 years — half a lifetime or longer — you won’t begin a love affair, you won’t live out the first minutes of desire or deny yourself an exciting sexual encounter in a train or on a plane,” Ms. Groult said in an interview that was included as a chapter in her 2008 autobiography, “My Escape.” (The title, she said, was a nod to her emancipation from the constraints of marriage and social conventions driven by men.)By her own account Ms. Groult was a late bloomer, as both an author and a feminist. Having taught Latin and worked in radio while raising children, she was in her 40s when she began a writing career and in her 50s when she embraced feminism.But once she took up those pursuits, she went all out, proving to be a prolific writer and an ardent activist, campaigning against female genital mutilation and other abuses.She was 55 when her book “Ainsi Soit-Elle” (loosely translated as “As She Is”) was published in 1975. It became an instant best seller in France (it was never published in English) and sealed Ms. Groult’s reputation as a leading feminist.The book explored the history of women’s rights as well as misogyny and violence against women, including sexual mutilation, which she wrote about after encountering it on a visit to Burkina Faso, then called Upper Volta.She went on to write “Salt on Our Skin” when she was 65; her last book, “Ainsi Soit Olympe de Gouges,” was published when she was 93.That last book explored women’s rights during the French Revolution, centering on the early French feminist Olympe de Gouges, who was guillotined in 1793 for challenging male authority. In 1791 de Gouges had published, as a pamphlet, a declaration of women’s rights (“Déclaration Des droits de la Femme et de la Citoyenne”).Ms. Groult published more than 20 novels as well as many essays on feminism. She also helped found a short-lived feminist monthly, F magazine. She was made an officer of the French Légion d’Honneur, the highest French order for military and civil excellence, this year.Ms. Groult attributed her belated awakening to feminism to her “bluestocking” Roman Catholic upbringing, which she said had given her few female role models.“I discovered that freedom isn’t just picked up naturally,” she wrote in her autobiography. “It’s something you have to learn, day after day, and very often painfully.” For that “apprenticeship,” she added, “I needed other women, those models who had been carefully hidden from me during the course of my education.”Benoîte Groult was born on Jan. 31, 1920, in Paris to an affluent family of designers.Her father, André Groult, designed furniture. Her mother, the former Nicole Poiret, founded a fashion house. Ms. Groult’s uncle, Paul Poiret, also a fashion designer, was considered a pioneer of the Art Deco style. Her godmother was Marie Laurencin, the French Cubist painter and printmaker.Ms. Groult studied Latin and Greek at the Sorbonne.Ms. Groult married four times. Her first and second husbands died of illnesses shortly after their weddings. In 1951 she married Georges de Caunes, a journalist, with whom she had two daughters, Blandine and Lison. She later married the writer Paul Guimard, with whom she had one daughter, Constance. (He died in 2004.)She is survived by what she had described as her “lovely, utterly feminine, line of descendants” — her three daughters as well as granddaughters and at least one great-granddaughter.Married women, Ms. Groult wrote, were in a particularly poor position to lead an effective fight for equality. “When the ‘oppressor’ is your lover and the father of your children and often the principal purveyor of the funds, freedom becomes a complex and risky undertaking,” she wrote in her autobiography. “So much so that many women prefer security, even under supervision, to the hazards of freedom.”Women in France won the right to vote only in 1945, when Ms. Groult was 25, and she spent a good part of her life without contraceptives, resorting instead to numerous illegal abortions.In a recent interview with the newspaper Ouest-France, Ms. Groult reflected on her novel about Olympe de Gouges. She was asked what advice that feminist would have for women today.“She would have said: ‘Don’t get married, it’s not worth divorcing. Stay free and write what you want, in words that are yours,’” she replied. But many women, she added, would find that advice difficult to follow even today.Olympe de Gouges could have avoided the guillotine and chosen a safer but oppressed life, Ms. Groult said. Yet she “braved all the conventions, and God knows that was hard.”
