Brian Asawa, one of the world’s foremost countertenors, whose repertoire ran from the Renaissance to Rorem, died on Monday in Mission Hills, Calif. He was 49.The cause was heart failure after a long illness, his sister, Cindy Rouze, said.Of Japanese ancestry, Mr. Asawa was among the relatively few Asian-Americans to attain stardom in the world of classical singing. He appeared on the stages of the Metropolitan Opera, the Paris Opera, the Mostly Mozart Festival, Carnegie Hall and elsewhere.Countertenors are curious creatures: men with the approximate range of mezzo-sopranos. Mr. Asawa was one of only a handful of them to enjoy international renown.“For so many years the countertenors were sounding like they were from outer space,” Peter Somogyi, a founding partner, with Mr. Asawa, of Asawa & Associates, a Los Angeles management concern representing singers and opera directors, said in an interview on Wednesday. “It was such a hybrid voice type. And when Brian came along he just made it sound so fluid and effortless.”In 1991, Mr. Asawa became the first countertenor to win the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, the annual competition that is a steppingstone to a Met debut.“I had entered the Met auditions for the sake of experience, with no thought of making it beyond the regional level,” Mr. Asawa told The New York Times in 1994. “When I got the application, there wasn’t even a category for countertenor. When I won, I was really pleased, because it meant that the Met acknowledged the countertenor as a viable voice type.”At its best, the voice of a countertenor can be piquant, ethereal and haunting. At its worst, it can be thready and attenuated, hooting like a tin whistle, an appraisal with which countertenors of bygone days were often saddled.Though countertenors were legion in the Renaissance and Baroque eras, with John Dowland, Purcell and Handel writing for them, they had largely fallen out of favor by the 19th century.By the 20th, they were consigned almost entirely to the early-music pale. “Bearded ladies,” members of the classical-music establishment sneeringly called them.Today, however, thanks to the exquisite voices of singers like Mr. Asawa and David Daniels — and the eagerness of such singers to commission new work — countertenors have embarked on a vigorous revival.Mr. Asawa, critics concurred, was neither thready nor hooty. He was widely praised for the size, richness, agility and silvery beauty of his voice, as well as for his superb musicianship, engaging stage presence and impeccable diction in a Babel of languages.“In a remarkable recital on Monday night at the Walter Reade Theater, Brian Asawa showed the kind of pure, effortless countertenor voice that comes along only once in a long while,” Alex Ross wrote in The Times in January 1994. “It is hard to convey the uncanny effect of his full, fluid, lustrous tone, poised in the extreme upper register without the slightest strain."Mr. Asawa made his formal Met debut the next month, as the voice of Apollo in Benjamin Britten’s “Death in Venice.”He returned to the Met in 1999 and 2000 — the 19th- and early-20th-century fare to which the company traditionally inclines provides few roles for countertenors — as Tolomeo in Handel’s “Giulio Cesare.”Mr. Asawa was closely associated with the San Francisco Opera, where his roles included Oberon in Britten’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” He also sang with the Santa Fe Opera, the Houston Grand Opera and the Hamburg State Opera, and on a string of acclaimed recordings.All this was a far cry from the days when he was a young tenor and, by dint of singing to the redwoods in the forests of California, discovered his authentic voice.Brian Laurence Asawa was born on Oct. 1, 1966, in Fullerton, Calif., and reared in Los Angeles. His father, George, was a chemist; his mother, the former Fusako Yoshida, ran a hair salon. An aunt, Ruth Asawa, who died in 2013, was a noted sculptor.As a youth, Brian sang in his church choir and played the piano, cello and trombone. He entered the University of California, Santa Cruz, as a piano major and sang tenor in the university chorus.One day, walking home from a rehearsal, he made a remarkable discovery.“On the way back to the dorms in the middle of the redwood forest, I would sing the soprano line of the choral music for fun in my falsetto voice,” Mr. Asawa told The Associated Press in 1999. “I discovered I had a strong voice in that range.”To his voice teacher, Mr. Asawa gingerly broached the idea of becoming a countertenor.“He could so easily have said: ‘Dude! What voice is this?’” Mr. Asawa recalled in a 2003 interview with The Seattle Times. “But instead he was very encouraging.”There were few living role models for young countertenors then. But when it came to charting that vocal course, Mr. Asawa later said, he felt he possessed a staggering advantage.“Heterosexual men don’t feel comfortable singing in a treble register because it’s not butch”, he told the magazine The Advocate in 1998. “Gay men feel quite comfortable singing in their falsetto voices.”He transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where his voice teachers included Virginia Fox and Kari Windingstad.After earning his bachelor’s degree there, he began graduate studies in early-music performance at the University of Southern California, where he worked with the lutenist James Tyler. His singing career took off before he could finish his degree.Mr. Asawa’s marriage to Keith Fisher ended in divorce. A resident of Los Angeles, he is survived by his mother and sister.Though Mr. Asawa was best known as a Handel specialist, he cast a musical net that spanned centuries. He commissioned works from contemporary composers, among them Jake Heggie, whose song cycle for him, “Encountertenor,” with lyrics by John Hall, includes the memorably titled “The Trouble With Trebles in Trousers.”Mr. Asawa’s discography includes “The Dark Is My Delight,” a collection of 16th-century songs with the lutenist David Tayler; “More Than a Day: Music of Ned Rorem”; and “Vocalise,” with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields under Sir Neville Marriner.When introducing people to his recordings, Mr. Asawa — whose speaking voice did not betray the heights he could scale as a singer — often found himself having to do some explaining.“When my friends listened to the ‘Vocalise’ record,” he told The A.P., “they said: ‘Who’s that woman? When are you coming on?’”
