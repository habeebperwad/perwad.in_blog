Willie Richardson, an All-Pro receiver for the Baltimore Colts and their leading pass-catcher in Super Bowl III, when the Jets otherwise stymied their offense in a huge upset victory, died on Monday in Jackson, Miss. He was 76.His wife, Earline, said that he died suddenly at their home and that the cause was not immediately known.Richardson came from a powerful football family in Mississippi. He was one of six brothers to play for the historically black Jackson State College (now Jackson State University), and one of four to go on to the professional ranks. At Jackson State he was a small-college all-American receiver. The College Football Hall of Fame inducted him in 2003.The Jets chose him in the third round of the American Football League draft in 1963, and the Colts selected him in the seventh round of the N.F.L. draft. He signed with the Colts, and played for them in eight of his nine pro seasons.Richardson’s best season was 1967, when he set career highs with 63 catches for 860 yards and eight touchdown receptions; he was selected for the N.F.L.’s first-team All-Pro squad and a spot in the Pro Bowl. He caught eight touchdown passes again in 1968, helping to propel the Colts to the Super Bowl, and was again chosen for the Pro Bowl.The Jets and their star quarterback, Joe Namath, gave the upstart A.F.L.’s reputation a huge boost, stunning the Colts, 16-7, in Super Bowl III in Miami in January 1969. But Richardson caught six passes for 58 yards in the game, while receiver Jimmy Orr and tight end John Mackey had only three receptions apiece, along with modest reception yardage.Earl Morrall, starting at quarterback in place of Johnny Unitas, who missed most of the 1968 season with an elbow injury, nearly connected with Richardson for a touchdown in the second quarter, with the Colts trailing, 7-0. But Jets defensive back Johnny Sample, a former Colt, intercepted the pass, giving the Jets the ball at their 2-yard line. Unitas entered the game later, but the Colts’ only touchdown came on the ground.Willie Louis Richardson Jr., the son of a Baptist preacher, was born on Nov. 17, 1939, in Clarksdale, Miss. His father and his mother, Alice, moved the family to Greenville, Miss., soon afterward, and Willie Jr. became a star high school receiver there.He played for the Colts from 1963 to 1969, spent one season with the Miami Dolphins, then concluded his career with the Colts in 1971. He had 195 career receptions for 2,950 yards and 25 touchdowns.After retiring from football, he was an administrator in the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration and an analyst for Jackson State football broadcasts.In addition to his wife, Richardson is survived by their son, Willie L. Richardson III; their daughters, Sonji Boyce and Shawn Terry; his brothers Gloster, Charles and Allen; a sister, Mary Alice Hutchins; and six grandchildren.Gloster Richardson played for the Kansas City Chiefs, including their Super Bowl IV championship team, and for the Dallas Cowboys and the Cleveland Browns. The other two brothers who played pro ball were Tom Richardson, for the Boston Patriots (now the New England Patriots), and Ernie Richardson, for the Browns. Both are deceased.When Willie Richardson joined the Colts, he faced stiff competition to make the team, and he learned quickly what was expected of him.“As a rookie, I saw that Raymond Berry and Jimmy Orr never dropped balls in practice, much less in games,” he told The Baltimore Sun in 2012. “Miss one pass and you felt like you didn’t belong. Those guys raised the bar for the rest of us.”
