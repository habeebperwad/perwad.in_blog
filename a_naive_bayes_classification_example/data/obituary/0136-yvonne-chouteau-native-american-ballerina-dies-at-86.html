Yvonne Chouteau, a former principal dancer of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo who emerged as one of a celebrated group of dancers known as the American Indian ballerinas of Oklahoma, died on Sunday at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 86.The cause was congestive heart failure, said Mary Margaret Holt, director of the School of Dance and dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of Oklahoma. Ms. Chouteau was a founder of the dance school, one of the leading institutions of its kind in the Southwest.A dancer of great radiance and lyricism, Ms. Chouteau was one of five prominent Native American dancers who were raised in Oklahoma. The others were Rosella Hightower, Moscelyne Larkin, Maria Tallchief and her sister Marjorie Tallchief, now the last survivor.The women were sometimes called the state’s “Five Moons,” which became the title of a set of bronze sculptures by Monte England and Gary Henson that were installed on the lawn of the Tulsa Historical Society. They are also depicted in a mural by Mike Larsen that hangs in the rotunda of the Oklahoma State Capitol.Part French and part Shawnee-Cherokee, Myra Yvonne Chouteau was born into a pioneering Southwestern family in Fort Worth on March 7, 1929, the only child of Corbett Edward Chouteau and the former Lucy Annette Taylor. The family soon moved to Vinita, Okla., and her father, who was known as C. E. Chouteau, became a prominent American Indian figure in the state.Ms. Chouteau was a direct descendant of Maj. Jean Pierre Chouteau (1758-1849), who established Oklahoma’s oldest white settlement in 1796.A child prodigy as a dancer — she liked to joke that if one reversed the syllables in her surname, “Chou-teau” became “Toe-shoe” — Ms. Chouteau started dancing when she was 2 1/2 years old. She received early training in Oklahoma and then in New York City, where she attended the School of American Ballet.She was accepted into the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at 14, becoming the company’s youngest dancer at the time. She performed her first solo role when she danced the Prayer variation in “Coppélia” in 1945, an interpretation that the critic Edwin Denby, in his book “Looking at the Dance,” called “lovely in every way.”Major roles soon followed in “Raymonda,” “Paquita,” “The Nutcracker” and “Pas de Quatre.” Describing Ms. Chouteau in performance, the British critic P. W. Manchester wrote, “Although she is tall and strongly built, she is very light and brings an ecstatic quality to her dancing.”Ms. Chouteau married her fellow Ballet Russe dancer Miguel Terekhov in 1956 and left the company the next year, when she was expecting a baby. Always proud of being an Oklahoman — in 1947 she became the first person under 50 to be inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame — she returned to the state and settled there with her husband.Mr. Terekhov joined her in 1963 in founding the School of Dance at the University of Oklahoma as well as the Oklahoma City Civic Ballet, precursor of today’s Oklahoma City Ballet. He died in 2012.Ms. Chouteau is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth A. Impallomeni and Christina Conway, and two grandsons.
