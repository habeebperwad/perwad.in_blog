Alan Vega, the singer in the minimalist, proto-punk, proto-electro, proto-industrial two-man band Suicide and a prolific musician and visual artist on his own, died on Saturday. He was 78.His death was announced in a statement from his family posted by the musician Henry Rollins, a longtime friend. The statement said he died in his sleep but did not say where he died or specify a cause. Mr. Vega had a stroke in 2012, but had continued to work as a visual artist.Suicide, particularly in its early years, was as much a provocation as a concert act. Formed in 1970, it was one of the first bands to bill themselves as “punk music.” With Martin Rev playing loud, insistently repetitive riffs on keyboards and drum machines and Mr. Vega crooning, chanting, muttering and howling his lyrics about insanity, mayhem and death, Suicide fiercely polarized its audiences.“We almost got killed. I love that reaction,” Mr. Vega once reminisced about Suicide’s debut at the Boston nightclub the Rat. “I’d say one half wanted to kill us and one half loved us.”A notorious 23-minute show recorded in Brussels in 1978 turned into a riot; Suicide released a recording of it. Suicide’s music would later be more widely tolerated, recognized as a precursor of electronic dance music and industrial rock.Although Suicide disbanded in the early 1980s, Mr. Vega and Mr. Rev occasionally reunited; in all, the duo released five studio albums from 1977 to 2002. Mr. Vega also made more than a dozen albums on his own and with collaborators. His music continued to explore repetition, drones, improvised lyrics and startling subject matter, but he also revealed his roots in rockabilly and sang an occasional love song.In the 2000s Mr. Vega resumed his career as a visual artist, with drawings and with sculptures often made from junk found on New York City streets.Mr. Vega was born Boruch Alan Bermowitz on June 23, 1938 in New York City, and grew up in the Bensonhurst area of Brooklyn. He majored in fine arts and physics at Brooklyn College, studying with Ad Reinhardt and Kurt Seligmann. In the late 1960s he was affiliated with Museum: A Project of the Living Artists, a multimedia gallery, studio and performance loft in Greenwich Village, where he experimented with electronic music and made sculptures featuring light bulbs and found materials. He and Mr. Rev played their first shows as Suicide there.Mr. Vega had been galvanized by seeing a concert at which Iggy Pop, lead singer of the Stooges, leapt into the audience and ended the show bloody and triumphant. “It showed me you didn’t have to do static artworks; you could create situations, do something environmental,” Mr. Vega told The Village Voice in 2002. “That’s what got me moving more intensely in the direction of doing music.”In the trashy, fertile downtown New York City arts world of the early 1970s, Suicide performed at the Mercer Arts Center, Max’s Kansas City and CBGB as well as at art galleries. The band was initially a trio, including a guitarist, but by 1972 it was just Mr. Vega and Mr. Rev. .Suicide’s self-titled debut album was released in 1977. It included a staple of the duo’s live shows, “Frankie Teardrop,” a 10-minute song with a relentless two-note keyboard line and a hissing electronic beat about a desperate factory worker who kills his wife and child. The album received praise in England but negative reviews from The Voice and from Rolling Stone (which would much later place it in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time).In 1978 the duo toured Europe and Britain, opening for Elvis Costello and the Clash; it was often booed and sometimes worse. In Glasgow, Mr. Vega ducked a flying ax.“Everybody came in to see Suicide to be entertained,” he told Ink19 magazine, “and all we did was give them back the street, in all its glory, and that’s what they hated us for.”But Suicide also garnered fans like Bruce Springsteen, who has said he modeled his song “State Trooper” on “Frankie Teardrop.” Mr. Springsteen has often played Suicide’s “Dream Baby Dream” in concert, and recorded it for his 2014 album “High Hopes.” Ric Ocasek, the Cars’ main songwriter, produced Suicide’s second album, “Suicide: Alan Vega and Martin Rev,” in 1980, and would continue to contribute to Mr. Vega’s solo albums.Mr. Vega’s first two solo albums, “Alan Vega” and “Collision Drive,” traded keyboards for echoey guitars and a rockabilly backbeat, and he had a European hit with “Jukebox Babe.” In the early 1980s he was signed to Elektra Records, and with Mr. Ocasek producing he made his closest approach to pop on the album “Saturn Strip” in 1983.He was also working as a visual artist. An exhibition of his assemblages inaugurated Barbara Gladstone’s downtown gallery in 1983.On later solo albums, Mr. Vega set aside pop expectations, following his inclinations toward ferocious electronic propulsion, guitar twang and blunt lyrics, combined without compromise. One of his musical collaborators during the 1990s, Liz Lamere, married him; she survives him, as does their son, Dante.Meanwhile, Mr. Vega had exhibitions of his art in France and New York. In 2002, Jeffrey Deitch mounted “Collison Drive,” featuring reconstructions of some of Mr. Vega’s 1970s works, at his gallery in Lower Manhattan. And last year the Invisible-Exports gallery on the Lower East Side presented what it said was his first full exhibition of new work since 1983.By the 1990s, reunion tours by Suicide met audiences who were no longer hostile, but admiring. “You can’t cause a riot now, anyway,” Mr. Vega said in a 2003 interview. “The kids today, they’ve seen it all already.”
