Judith S. Kaye, the first woman named to the highest court in New York and the first to serve as the state’s chief judge — a job she held longer than any of her 21 male predecessors — died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.Her death, from cancer, was confirmed by her granddaughter Sonja Hagemeier.Judge Kaye presided over the seven-member Court of Appeals for nearly 16 years and also supervised the $2.5 billion, 16,000-employee statewide judicial system, which she modernized by making jury service more equitable and convenient and by establishing boutique courts concerned as much with problem-solving as with punishment.In specialized courts that focused on community quandaries and on crimes involving drugs and domestic violence, New York judges now have alternatives to sending a defendant to jail, among them ordering treatment for addiction and mental illness and providing social services for victims of abuse.Keeping a campaign promise to name a woman, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, soon after taking office in 1983, appointed Ms. Kaye, a fellow Democrat and then a commercial litigator, as an associate judge of the Court of Appeals.She distinguished herself on the court by writing majority opinions that voided the state’s mandatory death penalty for murderers already imprisoned for life, and broadening news media access to pretrial hearings.A decade later, the governor elevated Judge Kaye to chief judge when Sol Wachtler abruptly resigned in disgrace after his arrest on charges of blackmailing his former lover and her daughter in a bizarre attempt to win back the older woman’s affections.As chief judge, Judge Kaye was esteemed as a collegial consensus builder, but she was best remembered for a dissent she delivered in 2006 in Hernandez v. Robles, when a four-judge plurality ruled that same-sex couples had neither a constitutional nor a statutory right to marry.Judge Kaye, invoking the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution and refusing to consign the issue to the State Legislature, wrote, “I am confident that future generations will look back on today’s decision as an unfortunate misstep.”The Legislature acted to legalize same-sex marriage five years later.Rejecting overtures to join the Clinton administration after 1992 as attorney general and a possible Supreme Court nomination, Judge Kaye served until 2008, when she reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.She was born Judith Ann Smith on Aug. 4, 1938, in Monticello, N.Y., a village in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. Her parents, Benjamin Smith and the former Lena Cohen, were Jewish immigrants from Poland who lived on a small farm and later opened a women’s clothing store in the village.Skipping two grades, Judith graduated from high school at 15 and graduated in 1958 from Barnard College, where she hoped her degree in Latin American civilization would lead to a job in journalism. She got as far as The Hudson Dispatch in Union City, N.J., where she, like many women in a male-dominated industry, was assigned to society news.She left The Dispatch to pursue a legal career. To enhance her employment opportunities, she worked as a copy editor for a news service during the day and attended New York University Law School at night.She graduated in 1962, one of 10 women in a class of nearly 290 (she graduated sixth in the class). She was soon hired by Sullivan & Cromwell, one of New York’s most venerable firms.She also married a colleague at the law firm, Stephen Rackow Kaye. He died in 2006. She is survived by their three children, Luisa, Jonathan and Gordon Kaye; seven grandchildren; and a brother, Allen Smith.Ms. Kaye left Sullivan & Cromwell after two years to join the IBM legal department. While raising a family, she worked part time as an assistant to the N.Y.U. Law School dean. She was later hired by Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O’Donnell & Weyher in New York, and there, in 1975, she became the first woman to be named partner.A list of potential appointees submitted to Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, by the New York State Commission on Judicial Nomination for the first Court of Appeals vacancy in 1983 included no women. When another vacancy occurred shortly thereafter, the commission’s list of seven candidates included two women: Justice Betty Weinberg Ellerin of State Supreme Court, a former president of the Women’s Bar Association; and Ms. Kaye, whom the association, in contrast to other bar groups, rated not qualified.After interviewing her twice, the governor appointed her anyway, to a 14-year term.From the beginning, Judge Kaye proved ready to invoke the State Constitution whenever it provided greater protections on civil liberties issues — matters of free speech and unreasonable searches, for example — than the United States Constitution.In one case, she ruled that the state was liable for not providing New York City public school students with the “sound basic education” required by the State Constitution. She voted four times against the death penalty. Writing a majority opinion, she went beyond the scope of a United States Supreme Court ruling in giving defendants greater latitude to accuse prosecutors of withholding evidence. She sided with the defendant in an important libel case. And she agreed with the majority in granting gay men and lesbians the right to adopt their partners’ children.Judge Kaye prided herself on nudging her fellow jurists toward a unanimous opinion, though that became more challenging in 1997, when Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, began filling vacancies.“She was in the mainstream of thinking in New York,” said Jonathan Lippman, her chief administrative judge and successor as chief judge, “and her view was that the court should speak with one voice, to create consensus around a pragmatic view of what the law should be.”As an administrator as well as a judge — “each of these jobs took 80 percent of my time,” she said — she was instrumental in the creation of courts devoted to specific problems, like drug abuse, as well as locally focused courts, including the Midtown Community Court in Times Square, which has dealt with panhandling, prostitution and other neighborhood issues.“Judith Kaye essentially started a revolution,” Judge Lippman wrote in 2009 in The N.Y.U. Law Review, “that has redefined the traditional role of the judiciary in addressing the difficult social problems reflected in our record-breaking court dockets: drug abuse, family violence and dysfunction, mental illness and so many more.”Judge Kaye expanded the jury pool by eliminating virtually all automatic exemptions, reducing the average length of service and ending the automatic sequestration of juries in criminal cases.She also lobbied for no-fault divorce laws and for lawyers to be held to higher standards.But she failed on two fronts that required the politically divided Legislature’s full cooperation. One was the complete overhaul of New York’s convoluted court system. (The Supreme Court, despite its name, is the third-highest jurisdiction.)The other was an overdue raise for judges after a decade. She finally joined other judges in suing Gov. David A. Paterson and the Legislature in 2008, arguing they had been denied their constitutional right to an adequate salary. The Court of Appeals eventually agreed, and while it did not recommend a remedy, the next year lawmakers approved a raise.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Thursday that Judge Kaye “believed in the fundamental promise of equal rights for all New Yorkers, and dedicated herself to strengthening our judicial system and our juries.”After she retired as chief judge, Judge Kaye became of counsel to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York.She was also appointed by Governor Paterson to the 12-member Commission on Judicial Nomination. She was named its chairwoman in 2009.In 2010, Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who was then the state’s attorney general, named her independent counsel to investigate several alleged ethics violations by Mr. Paterson.She found that Mr. Paterson had misled state investigators about his acceptance of free tickets to the World Series and forwarded her findings to the Albany County district attorney to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for perjury charges. He declined to prosecute.Judge Kaye also investigated a case involving a top Paterson aide whom a woman had accused of domestic violence. Witnesses said the aide and a top State Police official had tried to discourage the woman from pressing charges. Judge Kaye found that Governor Paterson and his advisers had made errors of judgment in their handling of the case, but that their actions had not been criminal.When Mario Cuomo appointed Judge Kaye, Marjorie E. Karowe, then the president of the women’s bar group, called his decision “unfortunate.” By 2008, Ms. Karowe had reversed her verdict.“Judge Kaye,” she said, “has proved herself to be a remarkable chief judge.”
