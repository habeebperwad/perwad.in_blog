Violette Verdy, a French-born ballerina who became one of New York City Ballet’s most acclaimed stars by bringing her deep musicality, effervescent presence and theatrical flair to George Balanchine’s plotless ballets, died on Monday in Bloomington, Ind. She was 82.Her cousin Annick Horville-Chateaureynaud said she died after a brief illness. Ms. Verdy lived in Bloomington and taught at Indiana University there. She had earlier directed the Paris Opera Ballet and the Boston Ballet.When Balanchine invited Ms. Verdy to join his 10-year-old company in 1958, even she was surprised. Her personal style of inflected dancing — marked by accents, technical brio and hints of occasional drama — seemed antithetical to the straightforward pure-movement style that Balanchine promoted in City Ballet as choreographer and artistic director.As she often recalled, she felt she would not fit in with the company’s long-legged, fleet-footed female dancers, who were encouraged to “just dance,” as Balanchine reportedly wished. These dancers were Borzois, she feared, and she would be a French poodle.Yet today Ms. Verdy remains memorably identified with key roles she created in Balanchine ballets like “Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux,” “Emeralds,” “Liebeslieder Walzer” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” When Jerome Robbins returned to the company in 1969 after a long absence, he immediately created similar signature roles for her in “Dances at a Gathering” (with its mysterious girl-in-green solo) and “In the Night.”When she joined City Ballet, Ms. Verdy was 25, a child prodigy turned ballerina with an international reputation in Roland Petit’s experimental ballets in France, some experience in the 19th-century classics and a season of performances with American Ballet Theater In 1957-58.Rather than being a disadvantage, this background may have attracted Balanchine.“Balanchine wanted her because she brought to his company something it didn’t have,’’ Mr. Petit says in Dominique Delouche’s documentary “Violette et Mr. B.” “She was unique, but she had what exceptional female French dancers all had at that time: theatrical alchemy.”She was also linked to Balanchine through the Russian training he shared with the teachers she had in Paris: Carlotta Zambelli, a former star of the Paris Opera Ballet, and Rousane Sarkissian, a noted Russian émigré teacher known as Madame Rousane, who studied with the Russians Ivan Clustine and Vera Trefilova. Another of her teachers, Victor Gsovsky, trained in Leningrad.Not only did Ms. Verdy fit into City Ballet; her trademark qualities also influenced Balanchine’s choreography. He used her clarity and the impressive articulation in her legs and feet in “Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux” to produce what she called “something to be joyous with.”Praising her gift for reflecting musical phrasing in her dancing, Clive Barnes wrote in The New York Times, “Just to see her phrase music is an experience akin to hearing a great pianist.”Violette Verdy was born Nelly Armande Guillerm on Dec. 1, 1933, in Pont-l’Abbé, a French seaside town in Brittany. Her father, Renan Guillerm, died a few months after her birth; her mother, Jeanne Chateaureynaud, was a schoolteacher who thought ballet lessons would suit her vivacious daughter. Determined to seek out excellent teachers, Mrs. Guillerm and Nelly moved to Paris in 1942 at the height of the wartime German occupation.Madame Rousane became Nelly’s main teacher, and by the mid-1940s her classes included French ballet’s new creative talents, Roland Petit, Jean Babilée and Maurice Béjart.Petit’s choreography, with its poetic themes of postwar disillusion or witty social allegories, created a sensation with his company, Les Ballets des Champs-Élysées. Nelly and Leslie Caron joined the troupe as teenagers shortly after Nelly made her professional debut in 1945 in “Le Poète,” Petit’s tale of an alienated poet.Along the way, Nelly turned to acting, appearing with the company of the famed actors Madeleine Renaud and Jean-Louis Barrault in Henry de Montherlant’s play “Malatesta.”At 16 she acted in a French feature film about a dancer’s macabre fantasies. The film was released in the United States in 1950 as “Dream Ballerina,” but not before the director, Ludwig Berger, insisted that she choose a stage name. From then on, she performed as Violette Verdy (a name reportedly invented by Petit to suggest a flower and the composer Verdi) and concentrated on a dance career.Petit formed a new company, Les Ballets de Paris de Roland Petit, in 1948 and reorganized it in 1953, the year his bitter fantasy ballet, “Le Loup,” made Ms. Verdy an international star. She portrayed a bride whose husband tricks her into living with a wolf.Petit’s fable, based on a libretto by the playwright Jean Anouilh, contrasted the gentleness of the beast with the prejudice of a society that kills those who upset established order.After a United States tour with London Festival Ballet in 1954 and guest appearances with La Scala and Ballet Rambert in London, where she danced her first “Giselle,” Ms. Verdy joined American Ballet Theater in 1957. She performed in Antony Tudor’s ballets, Birgit Cullberg’s dramatic “Miss Julie” and, by contrast, Balanchine’s neoclassic, plotless “Theme and Variations.”With New York City Ballet, she danced more than 140 ballets, both old and new. Her dynamism added exuberant depth to the Dewdrop role in “The Nutcracker,” while a turn of her head could signal rapture in “Liebeslieder Walzer.”The extraordinary solo Robbins created for her in “Dances at a Gathering” had her suggesting steps and gestures without executing them fully, communing in a private language. A different mystery pervaded her big solo in “Emeralds,” the first part of Balanchine‘s “Jewels.” Here, unusually, all was arm gesture, part of a beautiful flow.Known for her sense of humor, Ms. Verdy once coached a dancer in that role by saying: “Your arms should be doing something to you. One arm should astonish you.” As for a circular leg movement, she said, “It should be like stirring mayonnaise.”Ms. Verdy retired from dancing with City Ballet in 1977 to become director of the Paris Opera Ballet. After three years, she became co-artistic director and then artistic director of the Boston Ballet. She remained there until 1984.By her own account she was unsuited to be a company director. But she was in great demand as a ballet teacher. At Indiana University, she was named a distinguished professor and held the Kathy Ziliak Anderson chair in ballet at the university’s Jacobs School of Music.Ms. Verdy was briefly married to Colin Clark, a British journalist and the son of the art historian Kenneth Clark. It ended in divorce. Her survivors include an aunt and cousins.
