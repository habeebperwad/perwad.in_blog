Diana Balmori, a landscape architect whose ecologically sensitive designs integrated buildings and the natural environment in projects ranging in scope from urban rooftop gardens to South Korea’s new administrative capital, Sejong City, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 84.The cause was lung cancer, her son Denis Pelli said.Ms. Balmori championed a new understanding of landscape architecture and the built environment. She rejected the division between architecture and landscape, and the idea of landscaping as “shrubbing up,” as she sometimes put it: providing a beautiful backdrop for buildings. Instead, she saw the urban fabric as an interweaving of human activity, natural forces and designed settings and buildings.“It’s bringing all the pieces together,” she told Guernica magazine in 2013, describing her concept of landscape architecture. “It’s not just buildings, it’s not just road; it’s also social factors, geological factors, climate factors — a much more complex mix.” The goal, she said, was a blending of “very clear human engineering with ecology and with landscape.”She applied this philosophy to myriad prizewinning projects designed by her firm, Balmori Associates, which she founded in 1990. She developed the master plan to transform the old industrial port of Bilbao, Spain, into a park system connecting residents to the river, and to the art museum designed by Frank Gehry.In New Haven she worked with community organizations to develop a plan for converting 14 miles of abandoned rail line into a linear park extending through Yale University’s campus. She followed up with the Gwynns Falls Trail in Baltimore and a trail system in Cedar Lake Park in Minneapolis.In New York, which she envisioned as a vast laboratory for green thinking, Ms. Balmori designed a rooftop garden for the Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, and created the first garden atop a residential tower at the Solaire condominium complex in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan.Most dramatically, Ms. Balmori provided the landscape plans for South Korea’s version of Brasília, dominated by a series of linked buildings to house relocated government ministries in Sejong City, 75 miles south of Seoul. The low, serpentine structures, which, in a reversal of traditional practice, evolved from the landscape design, mimicked the natural forms of the Geumgang River and Charyeong Range nearby, with rooftop pedestrian walkways and gathering areas reminiscent of the High Line in New York.“Landscape design had been thought of as beautifying a site rather than something fundamental,” Barry Bergdoll, a professor of art history and archaeology at Columbia University, said in an interview. “Early on, Diana insisted that it should be a collaborative process with the building designer, and that landscape designers should think about how we use a site and how we live on the surface of the earth. With the ecological crisis we face now, this seems self-evident, but it wasn’t a half generation ago.”Diana Balmori (pronounced dee-AAH-na ball-MOOR-ee) was born on June 4, 1932, in Gijón, on the Bay of Biscay in northern Spain. Her mother, the former Dorothy Ling, was an English pianist and composer who, after earning a music degree from Cambridge, studied in Berlin, where she met her future husband, Clemente Hernando Balmori, a Spanish linguist also doing postgraduate work.Mr. Balmori, a Loyalist, fled with his family to England in 1936 to escape political persecution during the Spanish Civil War.Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he obtained a teaching position at the National University of Tucumán in Argentina, and the family moved once again. Diana often rode with him on horseback as he headed into remote areas to study the languages of indigenous tribes.Ms. Balmori studied architecture at the university but failed to receive a degree when the government, angered at a student protest, expelled her entire class. She emigrated to the United States in 1952 with her husband, the noted architect César Pelli, whom she had met at the university.In addition to her son Denis, a neuroscientist at New York University, she is survived by her husband; another son, Rafael Pelli, who is also an architect; and two granddaughters.Ms. Balmori moved to Los Angeles in 1964 and earned a doctorate in urban history at U.C.L.A. in 1973. A year later she began teaching at the State University of New York in Oswego, where she became interested in the landscape gardener Beatrix Farrand, the subject of her book “Beatrix Farrand’s American Landscapes” (1985), written with Diane Kostial McGuire and Eleanor McPeck.Landscape became Ms. Balmori’s consuming interest. In 1980 she joined her husband’s firm in New Haven, César Pelli & Associates, where she created a department of landscape architecture and worked with him on several projects, including the Winter Garden Atrium in the World Financial Center in Manhattan, where she planted a “grove” of 16 palm trees.After founding Balmori Associates, she put her evolving ideas about urban environments and landscape into practice in a wide range of projects, some for immediate use and others experimental.“Suddenly the set of ideas that landscape is working with is much more interesting than the set of ideas in architecture today; they just fit the time,” she told The Financial Times in 2013..In 2005 she realized a long-deferred plan proposed by the earthworks artist Robert Smithson, who in 1970, three years before his death in a plane crash, sketched out an idea for a garden that could travel by water around Manhattan. Working with Mr. Smithson’s widow, the artist Nancy Holt, Ms. Balmori designed “Floating Island,” a landscape of large rocks, soil, native trees and shrubs created on a flat barge that was towed around the city.Last year, she placed a prototype floating landscape in the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. Called GrowOnUs, it was planted with water-filtering flowers and grasses, and buoyed by recycled plastic bottles that offered habitat to mussels.“Eventually, we would like to create a productive island to grow food and herbs and fruits for city residents,” she told The Architects Newspaper.Ms. Balmori, who taught at the Yale School of Architecture and the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, also expressed her ideas about urbanism, sustainable design and the natural environment in books like “Redesigning the American Lawn: A Search for Environmental Harmony” (1993), written with F. Herbert Bormann and Gordon T. Geballe; “Groundwork: Between Landscape and Architecture” (2011), with Joel Sanders; and, most emphatically, in “A Landscape Manifesto” (2010), a set of 25 principles that guided her practice.“It is now space that interests us,” she told The Dirt, a blog of the American Society of Landscape Architects, in 2012. “And landscape is the discipline in which artistic ideas are being debated.”
