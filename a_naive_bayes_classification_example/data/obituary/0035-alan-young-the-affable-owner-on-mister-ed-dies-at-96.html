Alan Young, a comedian and veteran supporting actor who found wide fame as an unlikely sort of second fiddle — the hapless straight man to a talking horse in the 1960s sitcom “Mister Ed” — died on Thursday in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 96.His publicist, Jaime Larkin, said he died at the Motion Picture & Television Home, where he had been living for four years.Mr. Young had been a popular radio and television personality and had appeared in several films, including “Tom Thumb” (1958) and “The Time Machine” (1960), when, in his early 40s, he landed the role of Wilbur Post, the bumbling, well-meaning architect who owned a loquacious, fun-loving horse named Mr. Ed.“Mister Ed” became a hit, running from 1961 to 1966 on CBS. The episodes usually revolved around Wilbur’s clumsy attempts to undo Ed’s mischief, situations made more difficult by the fact that Ed would speak only to Wilbur.Mr. Young had a mischievous streak himself: Many years after the fact, he said he had started the rumor that the crew got Ed to “talk” by coating his mouth with peanut butter. Actually, the crew would place a piece of nylon in Ed’s mouth; the horse would then try to remove it by moving his lips, giving the illusion that he was talking when the voice of Allan Lane, a star of B westerns, was added. (Mr. Lane died in 1973).Mr. Young made his movie debut in “Margie,” a 1946 high school comedy set in the flapper era. He played the village piper in “Tom Thumb,” and in the 1960 film adaptation of H. G. Wells’s “The Time Machine” he played both David Filby, a friend of the time traveler (Rod Taylor), and Filby’s son as a grown man. Mr. Young also had a cameo role in the 2002 remake of the film.Early in his film career Mr. Young, a native of England, was often cast in what he called “all-American” supporting roles, for which he had to lose his accent. One of his few leading roles was as the title character in the 1952 musical “Aaron Slick From Punkin Crick," opposite Dinah Shore.He was born Angus Young in North Shields, England, on Nov. 19, 1919. His family moved to Edinburgh when he was a toddler and then to Canada when he was about 6. He made his radio debut at 13, and by the time he was 17 he was both a writer and a performer on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation show.Mr. Young’s radio career took off in 1944 with “The Alan Young Show”; originally a summer replacement for Eddie Cantor, it proved so popular that it remained on the air for five years. After the show was canceled in 1949, he hit the theater circuit, playing the bagpipes and doing stand-up comedy.In 1950 he brought “The Alan Young Show” to TV. It remained on the air until 1953. In 1951 it won the Emmy Award for best variety show, and Mr. Young won for best actor. (Sketch actors were included in that category at the time.)Throughout the ’50s he appeared in numerous TV roles and on the variety shows of Steve Allen, Ed Sullivan, Dinah Shore and others. In later decades he made guest appearances on dozens of series, including “Death Valley Days,” “The Love Boat,” “Coach” and “ER.”His last film was “Em & Me” (2004), an independent feature in which he played an elderly man traveling cross-country to visit his ex-wife’s grave.Mr. Young was also a frequently heard voice in animated movies like “The Great Mouse Detective” and television cartoon series like “The Ren & Stimpy Show” and “The Smurfs.” He was the voice of Scrooge McDuck in several Disney projects.He published two autobiographies: “Mister Ed and Me” (with Bill Burt) in 1995 and “There’s No Business Like Show Business ... Was” (2006), an account of his career and life in Hollywood.Mr. Young’s first marriage, to Mary Ann Grimes, with whom he had two children, ended in divorce. He married Virginia McCurdy, a singer, in 1948 and had two children with her; she died in 2011. His family declined to release information about survivors, his publicist said.
