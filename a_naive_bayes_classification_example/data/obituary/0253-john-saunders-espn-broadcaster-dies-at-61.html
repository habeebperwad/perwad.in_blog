John Saunders, a widely known ESPN and ABC sportscaster who guided viewers through many premier sporting events over the last 30 years, has died, ESPN announced on Wednesday. He was 61.The network provided no details on when and where he died or on the cause of death.Mr. Saunders was a familiar presence on fall Saturdays as the host of ABC’s studio coverage of college football and the ESPN show “College Football Live.” He anchored coverage of the College Football Playoff national championship game and hosted the postgame trophy presentation.On Sundays, he was the host of “The Sports Reporters,” an ESPN round table of journalists that largely resisted the shouting and argumentative style of shock jocks in favor of measured, one-at-a-time takes on sports issues, personalities and events.There was no trace of bombast in his presentation. As other sports broadcasters yelled progressively louder, Mr. Saunders was calm, steady and good-natured — “a voice of reason in our often unreasonable discourse,” as Mike Greenberg, an ESPN host, said on Twitter.Since starting at ESPN in 1986, Mr. Saunders had been at the center of the network’s biggest franchises. He hosted the channel’s studio coverage of college basketball and had called play-by-play for college basketball since 1990.

He was an all-star defenseman in junior league hockey and played at Western Michigan University from 1974 to 1976 with his brother, Bernie, before transferring to Ryerson Polytechnical in Toronto.He had broadcast jobs in Ajax and Toronto before moving to Baltimore, where he anchored daily sports reports. He was hired by ESPN in 1986 to anchor “SportsCenter.”On “SportsCenter” on Wednesday, Hannah Storm struggled to report the news of Mr. Saunders’s death, calling him “our generous and talented and beloved colleague.”Mr. Saunders is survived by his wife, Wanda, and two daughters, Aleah and Jenna.
