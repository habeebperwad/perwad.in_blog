Rosario Ferré, a formidable figure in Puerto Rican letters who wrote novels in both Spanish and English, and who was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1995 for the family epic “A House on the Lagoon,” which she translated herself from the original Spanish, died on Thursday at her home in San Juan, P.R. She was 77.Her son Benigno Trigo said the cause had not been determined.Ms. Ferré (pronounced fay-RAY) wrote about Puerto Rican identity, often in a historical context, often from a feminist perspective and often satirically. She depicted the mixture, that its people often express, of the exaggerated pride in the beauty and culture of the island and the exasperation with its patriarchal traditions and geographical and physical limitations.She came from a family prominent in both business and politics — her father, Luis A. Ferré, was governor of the island, a United States commonwealth, from 1969 to 1973 — and often wrote about the island’s aristocratic class. Her sweeping sagas, arch, stylized prose and dissections of the Latin American character sometimes drew comparisons to Gabriel García Márquez.She herself was a prominent figure. A poet, essayist and children’s book author as well as a novelist, she became well known early in her career as an editor of a literary magazine and as a newspaper columnist and critic. In the 1970s and ’80s she published a number of books in Spanish, including “Maldito Amor” (“Damn Love”), which comprised a novella and stories that expressed both a devotion to and amusement with her homeland and its people. She later translated that book into English — it was published as “Sweet Diamond Dust: And Other Stories” — and in a 1996 introduction, she wrote about the conflict that informs the psyche of both the Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico and the many who live on the mainland:“We spend a great part of our lives traveling to and from the continent, citizens of that no-man’s land shadowed by Eastern Airlines’ gliding silver ghosts. Even Puerto Rican taxi drivers in Chicago and New York who can’t go back often dream of buying their own little finquita in the mountains one day with their savings, where they can grow green plantains for tostones, drink milk straight from the cow’s udder and pick eggs from under a chicken’s warm breast every morning. Their children — like my children — may never come back to the island, but they will inherit the dream.”Ms. Ferré began writing in English in the 1990s in the hope of reaching a wider audience. Interviewed by The New York Times in 1998, she said that writing and thinking in another, less familiar language changed her style, making it less flamboyant and less complex.“When I get into Spanish, I go crazy with words,” she said. “In English, I don’t have the same linguistic repertory. I have no choice but to wear blinders and go straight.”The result, she said, sometimes ended up surprising her, rendering changes in her characters. “The House on the Lagoon” — a multigenerational story about a wealthy and problematically haughty family that begins in 1917, when Puerto Ricans were granted American citizenship, and ends in the 1980s — is told with rival narrators, a husband and wife, with often conflicting points of view. She wrote it first in Spanish, as “La Casa de la Laguna,” but as she recalled in a 2011 reminiscence (recently published in English as “Memoir”), she decided to translate it into English and send it to an American publisher; it ended up at Farrar, Straus & Giroux.In translation it doubled in size and changed so much that after it was published, she had to retranslate it back into Spanish. In English, Ms. Ferré said in the Times interview, she found that the patriarchal husband, Quintin Mendizabal, was “less unpleasant, nicer and more human,” whereas in Spanish, he was “a scoundrel who is not worthy of forgiveness.”Suzanne Ruta, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called that book “a work of self-conscious brilliance,” adding: “The novel’s stylized, picturesque reduction of class and racial conflict to two mythic families has been done before. But that’s just the point. Ms. Ferré, in effect, declares Puerto Rican literary independence by giving the island the same mini-epic treatment accorded sovereign nations like Chile and Colombia in the work of their leading novelists.”Rosario Josefina Ferré was born in Ponce, P.R., on Sept. 28, 1938. Her father was an industrialist and philanthropist who owned a cement company and a newspaper and, as a politician, was a founder of Puerto Rico’s New Progressive Party and one of the island’s staunchest advocates for statehood. A character in Ms. Ferré’s 1998 novel, “Eccentric Neighborhoods,” is modeled on him. Her mother, the former Lorencita Ramírez de Arellano, was a well-educated, highly literate woman who taught high school for a time and was not fond of public life. Her death in 1970 was something her daughter said she could not write about for decades until working in English gave her “a psychological distance” from her work, “as if another person were writing.”After finishing primary school in Ponce — she began learning English at age 7 in a Roman Catholic school — Ms. Ferré went to Wellesley College in Massachusetts for a time and graduated from Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. She earned a master’s degree in literature from the University of Puerto Rico, where she studied with Mario Vargas Llosa, and a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland.Ms. Ferré’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son Benigno, the chairman of the department of Spanish and Portuguese literature at Vanderbilt University, she is survived by her husband, Agustín Costa, an architect; another son, Luis Trigo; a daughter, Rosario Lorenza Trigo; a brother, Antonio; and a grandson.“Agustín and I went to the banquet in New York where they announced the winners of the prizes,” Ms. Ferré wrote in her memoir about the National Book Award, for which, as a writer largely unknown in the United States and making her first foray into English prose, she was a surprise nominee.“It was a night full of emotion. Our table was in front of the display where the prizes were sitting in a row, plaques made of glass with the names of the winners engraved on them. Since I had 20-20 vision, though the letters were inverted, I could read the words on the award that corresponded to me. I could see it was engraved with the name of Philip Roth.”Mr. Roth won the award for “Sabbath’s Theater.”“Needless to say, when we came close to the moment when the name of the winner was read out loud, I was crying, and Agustín did not know why.”
