Drew Lewis, who as transportation secretary under Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s led contract negotiations with the air traffic controllers’ union and, when many of its members went on strike, put together a temporary system to keep planes in the air, died on Wednesday in Prescott, Ariz. He was 84.The cause was complications of pneumonia, his son Andrew L. Lewis IV, known as Andy, said.Mr. Lewis, a business executive known for rescuing failing companies, achieved prominence in Pennsylvania politics by successfully managing several House and Senate campaigns for Richard S. Schweiker, a childhood friend.His work as state chairman for President Gerald R. Ford during the 1976 presidential campaign impressed Reagan, who as Ford’s rival had tried to woo Pennsylvania’s delegates by naming Senator Schweiker as his proposed running mate at the last minute. Mr. Lewis, despite heavy pressure from his old friend, delivered his bloc of delegates to Ford.In the next presidential election, Reagan enlisted Mr. Lewis to manage his primary campaign in Pennsylvania. After the nomination was locked up, Mr. Lewis served as second in command of the Reagan-Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee. He was picked to be secretary of transportation immediately after Reagan’s election.The airline unions presented him with the biggest crisis of his two-year tenure. He averted a walkout by the Air Line Pilots Association, and earned the union’s valuable good will, when he agreed to reconsider a proposal by the Federal Aviation Administration to allow airplanes to fly with two crew members rather than three.In June 1981 he represented the government in contentious negotiations with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, which demanded a shorter workweek and a substantial salary increase.Mr. Lewis’s contract offer was accepted by the union’s president but overwhelmingly rejected by union members; nearly 13,000 of them walked off the job in August, defying a law forbidding strikes by federal employees. Reagan announced that any striker who did not come back to work in 48 hours would be fired, but only about 1,300 controllers returned.During the strike, Mr. Lewis directed subordinates at the aviation agency to maintain emergency traffic control using personnel borrowed from the armed forces. Replacement controllers were trained quickly at the administration’s academy in Oklahoma City, and 50 small airports were temporarily shut down. The pilots’ union joined with Mr. Lewis to reassure the public that it was safe to fly.More than 11,000 strikers lost their jobs, and the union was decertified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority. A new union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, emerged to replace it in 1987.Philosophically opposed to federal regulation and a proponent of free-market solutions, Mr. Lewis cut Amtrak’s budget, tried to free the government from its involvement in the Conrail freight line and began shifting more of the responsibility for roads and bridges from the federal government to the states, although he persuaded Reagan to support an increase in the federal gasoline tax to help rebuild the interstate highway system.“We believe that the government’s proper role is to create the economic climate within which the states can plan and carry out their transportation programs, and within which the operators of transportation can supply the public demand — at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer,” Mr. Lewis told Nation’s Business magazine in 1981.Andrew Lindsay Lewis Jr. was born on Nov. 3, 1931, in Philadelphia and grew up on a farm in rural Norristown, Pa. His father ran a trucking business. After graduating from Norristown High School, he attended Haverford College in Pennsylvania, earning a degree in economics in 1953, and Harvard’s graduate school of business, where he received a master’s degree in business administration in 1955. He later did postgraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He joined Henkels & McCoy, a utilities contractor in Blue Bell, Pa., as a foreman and immediately confronted his first strike when electricians he was supervising at a communications station in the Azores islands, off the coast of Portugal, walked off the job. He flew to Madrid and found 15 Spanish electricians to complete the work.After rising to production manager and director at Henkels & McCoy, Mr. Lewis took senior management jobs at American Olean Tile and its parent company, National Gypsum. In the early 1970s, he turned around two failing companies, Simplex Wire and Cable and Snelling & Snelling, a personnel placement firm, and helped reorganize the bankrupt Reading Railroad, steering it toward absorption into Conrail.In 1974 he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Pennsylvania, losing to the incumbent, Milton Shapp. The following year he founded Lewis & Associates, a financial and management consulting firm, in Plymouth Meeting, Pa.He returned to the corporate world in February 1983, recruited by Warner Amex Cable Communications to turn the company around. He returned it to profitability in three years. In 1986 he was hired by Union Pacific, the nation’s largest railroad, to take over as chief executive after the retirement of William S. Cook in 1987.In 1994, while Union Pacific was attempting a hostile takeover of the Santa Fe Railroad, he took a leave of absence to enter an alcohol treatment program. He was later arrested twice, in 1995 and 2002, on suspicion of driving under the influence.After overseeing Union Pacific’s 1996 merger with Southern Pacific, Mr. Lewis retired to his farm, Lilliput, in Schwenksville, Pa.In addition to his son Andy, Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Stoughton; a daughter, Karen Carrier; a son, Russell, known as Rusty; 14 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. A fourth child, Andrew L. Lewis III, died in infancy.The battle with the air traffic controllers, and Mr. Lewis’s leading role, lingered long in the national memory. In 1986 Haverford College, founded by Quakers, planned to award Mr. Lewis an honorary doctor of laws degree at its commencement ceremony in June 1986.After learning that 28 faculty members had signed a petition objecting to the degree because of the air traffic controllers’ strike, Mr. Lewis declined to accept the honor, citing the Quaker belief in consensus rather than majority rule. Removing his doctoral hood, he told a stunned commencement audience, “There is no consensus on this degree when one-third of your faculty objects.” He was given a standing ovation.
