Carolyn See, a novelist and memoirist who built a writing life on the singularities and peculiarities of Los Angeles and its environs, where she lived much of her life, died on Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82.The cause was congestive heart failure, said the writer Lisa See, her daughter.Ms. See, a fluid and muscular stylist who emerged observant, imaginative and productive from a discomforting childhood, was a relatively late starter as a writer, though she went on to lead a full career as a woman of letters. Her books include seven novels, a memoir, a nonfiction book about the pornography industry and several other books written with her daughter or her longtime partner, John Espey.She taught writing at the University of California, Los Angeles, and was a prolific book reviewer, contributing regularly to The Washington Post for 27 years and frequently for other publications, including The New York Times.Ms. See wrote her first novel, “The Rest Is Done With Mirrors,” in her mid-30s. Set among graduate students at U.C.L.A., it tells a blunt tale of their semi-squalid lives as they become embroiled in conspiratorial doings involving germ warfare and espionage, and it introduced readers to Ms. See’s unusual mélange of interests.Her novels often put portraits of intimate relationships and sociological observations of the lives of Angelenos together with grander fictional ideas that resonate with political and social concerns of the moment.In “Mothers, Daughters” (1977), which begins in Los Angeles but takes place mostly in Northern California, and “Rhine Maidens” (1981), whose mother and daughter narrators live in different social strata and have little in common besides genes and unfulfilling marriages, Ms. See concentrated on women whose lives are being lived out disappointingly, the pain of riven generational ties and the emotional wanness of a society in the latter days of the sexual revolution.Her best-known book, “Golden Days” (1986), presents a post-apocalyptic view of Los Angeles in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. Narrated by a twice-divorced single mother who has moved with her two young daughters to Topanga Canyon, the book tells a counterintuitive tale of societal redemption after the world is nearly destroyed by powerful, misguided politicians.“If an inspirational novel about nuclear war seems a bit, well, perverse, that’s only the beginning (of the end, of course),” the journalist and women’s studies scholar Carol Sternhell wrote in The New York Times Book Review. She added:“Half black comedy, half trendy California chronicle (with plenty of sex and plenty of sunshine and plenty of gurus), half wicked feminist skewering of ‘grim-lipped men’ and their missiles, ‘Golden Days’ is defiantly rude and hilariously sad. The hope this disturbing novel eventually offers is as perverse as its wacky despair: an absolute refusal by a few, or many, California weirdos — particularly the graduates of positive-thinking workshops — to accept the end of the world.”Carolyn Penelope Laws was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 13, 1934, to George Laws and the former Kate Sullivan. They were mismatched, as Ms. See described them: he fun-loving and encouraging, she not so much. Her mother, she wrote, “had an even disposition; evenly bad.”“When she laughed,” she added, “it was at the expense of someone else.”Much of her family history was detailed in Ms. See’s 1995 memoir, “Dreaming: Hard Luck and Good Times in America.” After her parents separated, she lived with her mother most of the time until she was 16, moved in briefly with her father, and was out on her own by her late teens and married before she was 20. She had known her husband, Richard See, since high school, and he was in the Army, serving in Newfoundland, when they married.Her interest in writing was spurred by her father, who was a newspaperman for a time. On their weekends together he would take her to parties where writers would gather. In later life, George Laws, writing under myriad pseudonyms, published more than 70 pornographic novels.“At 69, he found his métier,” Ms. See recalled in a television interview. “He found what he loved. And he had a wonderful time.”Ms. See attended Los Angeles City College and graduated from California State University, Los Angeles. She earned a Ph.D. from U.C.L.A., writing her dissertation on the Hollywood novel. Her marriage to Mr. See, an anthropologist, ended in divorce, as did a second marriage, to Tom Sturak.In addition to her daughter Lisa, the author of the novel “Snow Flower and the Secret Fan” and other books, Ms. See is survived by another daughter, Clara Sturak; a brother, Bob Laws; three grandsons; and a great-grandson.Ms. See’s other books include the novels “Making History” (1991), about the intrusion of random violence into the life of a Los Angeles financier; “The Handyman” (1999), a semi-comic rumination on the power of art centering on a painter who, while on his way to fame, solves personal problems for a procession of clients; and “There Will Never Be Another You” (2006), a saga of a family spinning out of control amid a global threat of bioterrorism. She also wrote a volume of advice for writers, “Making a Literary Life” (2002).“They say L.A. is large, but they lie,” Ms. See wrote in “Golden Days,” in the voice of her narrator, Edith Langley, introducing a succinct passage that stands nicely for Ms. See’s view of her hometown. “It’s true there are a zillion places no one in his right mind would like: Lakewood, Torrance, Brea, Compton, Carson, no one real lived there, any more than real people lived in those gray asphalt boxes that line the roads between New York’s airport and its island. ‘Real’ L.A. had its thick, coiled root downtown, and on the east, little underground rootlets; obscure Mexican restaurants. Then a thin stem, the Santa Monica freeway, heading due west and putting out greenery, places in this western desert where you’d love to live — if things went right.”
