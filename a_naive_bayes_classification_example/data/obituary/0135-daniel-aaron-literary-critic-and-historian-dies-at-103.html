Daniel Aaron, a literary critic and historian who helped preserve the nation’s cultural heritage as a co-founder of the nonprofit Library of America and who pioneered the multifaceted academic field of American studies, died on Saturday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 103.The cause was complications of pneumonia, his daughter-in-law Anna Aaron said.Professor Aaron suggested in his autobiography that his chosen profession was augured when he was only 3, with the sinking of the British ocean liner Lusitania by a German U-boat in 1915.The victims included his mother’s mentor, Elbert Hubbard, a journalist who had founded the Roycroft artisan community in upstate New York in the late 19th century with his wife, Alice. Elbert Hubbard also wrote the best-selling inspirational essay “A Message to Garcia,” about the prelude to the Spanish-American War.Hearing about the sinking while growing up “foreshadowed my introduction to American history,” Professor Aaron wrote in the memoir, “The Americanist” (2007). But his route to being granted one of the first doctoral degrees in American civilization by Harvard and becoming an English professor at Smith College and Harvard was, much like history itself, hardly preordained.He entered the University of Michigan planning to study medicine, before switching to English. He then intended to pursue graduate studies at the University of London, until onerous conditions were attached to his enrollment there.Accepted instead by Harvard, he began his studies there in the English department, until it was suggested that a Jewish student might find a new multidisciplinary program in the history of American civilization more intellectually congenial. And only after the Germans occupied France in 1940 did he conclude that “it might be almost as important to understand American civilization as to preserve it.”He helped found the Library of America in 1979, the culmination of a proposal by his fellow critic Edmund Wilson in the 1950s. The company has published 9.5 million copies of 279 moderately priced novels, memoirs, narrative histories, forgotten masterpieces and other classics, beginning with Professor Aaron’s favorite, “Moby-Dick.”He wrote several major books himself. In “Men of Good Hope: A Story of American Progressives,” published in 1951, he sought to redeem progressivism from its disfavor during the McCarthy era, arguing that rebelling against injustice and inequality was ingrained in American middle-class tradition.In “Writers on the Left: Episodes in American Literary Communism” (1961), he took a nonaccusatory approach toward leftist authors by acknowledging that communism, for all its failings, had evoked a passion and hope that “cannot therefore be described simply as a ‘conspiracy.’”And in “The Unwritten War: American Writers and the Civil War” (1973), a finalist for the National Book Award, he faulted 19th- and 20th-century authors for failing to produce a fictional epic commensurate with the enormity of the war, and for refusing to acknowledge “the centrality of racial fear (not slavery itself, but black slavery) as the root of the conflict.” Too often, he wrote, blacks were portrayed “sentimentally and patronizingly.”In 1985, Professor Aaron turned his attention to the sprawling journal of the reclusive, troubled Arthur Crew Inman, a failed poet and scion of Southern wealth who chronicled his life and observations in the North with startling detail and candor in 155 volumes of more than 15 million words. Holed up in a Boston apartment, he committed suicide in 1963. Critics called the journal a remarkable document of American social history.Professor Aaron condensed it to 1,661 pages with the title “The Inman Diary: A Public and Private Confession.”“In Mr. Aaron’s adroitly edited version, Inman’s diary is a fascinating document, by turns bizarre and illuminating, poignant and obscene,” the psychologist Michael Vincent Miller wrote in The New York Times Book Review.But another reviewer, John Gross, also writing in The Times, balked at the book’s length.“Daniel Aaron’s abridgment in fact preserves less than a tenth of the original,” Mr. Gross said, “but even readers who become addicted to Inman (and it is easy to develop a taste for him) are likely to feel that 1,600 pages and more are quite enough to be getting on with.”In addition to his own memoir, Professor Aaron wrote “Commonplace Book, 1934-2012,” a distillation of the diary and scrapbook he started as a teenager, published in 2015.Daniel Baruch Aaron was born in Chicago on Aug. 4, 1912, to immigrants from Russia transplanted to the Midwest from New York. His father, Henry, was a lawyer who had multiple sclerosis. His mother was the former Rose Weinstein.The family moved to Los Angeles when he was 5. Within five years both his parents were dead. He returned to Chicago, where he was raised by relatives.He received a bachelor’s degree in English from Michigan in 1933 and entered Harvard at a time when the historian Samuel Eliot Morison still rode to campus on horseback. As a graduate student there, he graded what he called a “so-so” exam by a young John F. Kennedy and the English assignments of “an intense, hungry-looking” Norman Mailer.His doctoral dissertation on the development of Cincinnati boldly challenged the renowned Frederick Jackson Turner’s “frontier thesis,” suggesting that the city had more in common with the development of the urban eastern United States than the Western hinterlands. The doctorate “signalized my merger with the U.S.A. and my dehyphenizaton,” Professor Aaron wrote.Smith College hired him as a freshly minted Ph.D., and he taught there for 30 years. During wartime shortages of manpower, he worked on a farm and as a volunteer police officer. He also pitched for a softball team in Northampton, Mass.He and his wife, the former Janet Summers, had three sons, Jonathan, James and Paul. They survive him, as do several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Professor Aaron refused to be pigeonholed politically, characterizing himself as “an irregular in the ranks of the non-Communist left.”“I did not fit neatly into any political party and had no taste or talent for polemics,” he wrote. He was no fan of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy or of President Richard M. Nixon. (“Our detestation of him was almost as aesthetic as political,” he wrote of Nixon.)Professor Aaron at times served the government as a cultural ambassador abroad — a “native son neither estranged from the collective American family nor unreservedly clasped to its bosom,” he wrote. His role, he said, was “not to ‘sell’ the U.S.A. but to ‘explain’ it, not to palliate its blemishes but to contextualize them.”In 2010, he was awarded a National Humanities Medal as a scholar and as the founding president of the Library of America.In his memoir, he described himself as “a citizen of two Americas.”“One of them is the country of Uncle Sam,” he wrote, “an America, in the words of Herman Melville, ‘intrepid, unprincipled, reckless, predatory, with boundless ambition, civilized in the externals but savage at heart.’“The other is its blessed double, home of heroes and clowns and of the cheerful and welcoming democratic collective — ‘the place where I was born.’ For all of my romantic Satanism and the satisfaction I took and still take in the doctrine of original sin, it is this second America to which I feel culturally and temperamentally attuned.”
