Gordon Davidson, who as artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum for nearly 40 years helped establish Los Angeles as a West Coast capital of regional theater and challenged audiences with socially conscious plays, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 83.His wife, Judi Davidson, said he had collapsed at a family dinner. She said the cause of death had not been determined.Mr. Davidson, who was often regarded as the West Coast counterpart of Joseph Papp, the longtime director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, was a transplanted New Yorker who in 1967 was handed mission impossible when the civic leader Dorothy Chandler invited him to run the newly founded Mark Taper Forum, a 745-seat theater.In a city dominated by the film and television industries and notoriously indifferent to the stage, Mr. Davidson made it his mission to present demanding theatrical material, nurture new plays and playwrights, and build audiences.This he proceeded to do with remarkable success, often reversing the one-way creative flow from Broadway to Los Angeles. Plays that were developed at the Taper or had their premieres there include “In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” “The Trial of the Catonsville Nine,” “The Shadow Box,” “Children of a Lesser God” and Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America.” All transferred to the Broadway stage to great acclaim, often with Mr. Davidson directing.In 1977 he received a Tony Award for directing “The Shadow Box,” Michael Cristofer’s play about three groups of people facing death at a large hospital. That same year, the Taper was honored with a Tony for best regional theater.“I believe it must be the job of theater to take hard looks at life, at issues people don’t always want to confront,” Mr. Davidson told The New York Times in 1979. “They will listen to what is said to them from a stage. That is the power of theater. I respect it. I am in awe of it.”Gordon Davidson was born on May 7, 1933, in Brooklyn. His father, Joseph, was a well-known speech and drama teacher at Brooklyn College whose students included the humorist and television host Sam Levenson, the actor Alfred Drake and the film director Paul Mazursky. His mother, the former Alice Gordon, gave up a career as a concert pianist to raise her children.After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, where he was class valedictorian, Mr. Davidson enrolled as an electrical engineering student at Cornell. He switched his major to drama before graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1956. A year later he earned a master’s degree in directing for the theater from what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.In 1959 he married Judith Swiller, known as Judi. In addition to his wife, he is survived by their two children, Adam and Rachel; two brothers, Michael and Robert; and five granddaughters.With degrees in hand, Mr. Davidson took a job as stage manager with the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn. A year later he was working on Broadway as stage manager of the Phoenix Theater Company. One of his first productions was a revival of “The Great God Brown.”In 1964 the director John Houseman asked him to come to Los Angeles on short notice and assist him on a production of “King Lear” presented by the Theater Group at U.C.L.A. He was soon installed as the company’s managing director.Over the next two and half years, Mr. Davidson mounted 11 productions, most notably a 1966 resuscitation of Leonard Bernstein’s “Candide,” which had flopped on Broadway a decade earlier but returned to glorious life in the hands of Mr. Davidson. “It was staggeringly wonderful,” Bernstein told The New York Times in 1979.Mr. Davidson took on the Taper assignment with determination and lofty goals. He dismissed the idea of presenting a polite yearly calendar of theatrical classics, opting instead for meaty fare and committing to a program of developing new work.He courted disaster with his first production, “The Devils,” a play by John Whiting based on a book by Aldous Huxley. Set in the 17th century, it dealt with a promiscuous priest and the sexual fantasies of a nun, subjects that aroused the vocal opposition of the Roman Catholic clergy and some of the theater’s biggest donors.He quickly established the Taper as a serious force. After opening in Los Angeles in 1969, Heinar Kipphardt’s “In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” a dramatization of the moral struggle faced by the chief architect of the atomic bomb, moved to Lincoln Center, with Mr. Davidson directing. It set the tone for several political dramas to come.With Daniel Berrigan’s antiwar play “The Trial of the Catonsville Nine” (1972), Mr. Davidson received his first Tony nomination as director. He also directed a film version of the play produced by Gregory Peck.A second Tony nomination came in 1980, for his direction of “Children of a Lesser God,” Mark Medoff’s play about a teacher of the deaf who falls in love with one of his students. It won the Tony for best play, and its two leads, John Rubinstein and Phyllis Frelich, won Tonys as well.In 1978, “Zoot Suit,” Luis Valdez’s musical play about Chicano gangs in 1940s Los Angeles, opened at the Mark Taper Forum, with Edward James Olmos in the lead role. Developed at the Taper, it was hailed as a landmark in the history of Hispanic drama in the United States and played to packed houses for a year before transferring to Broadway.Even more celebrated was Mr. Davidson’s 1992 production of Mr. Kushner’s two-part AIDS epic, “Angels in America,” directed by Oskar Eustis, his associate artistic director, and Tony Taccone. It went on to become one of the most acclaimed American theatrical works of the later 20th century, winning a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony among other awards.A year later he presented “The Kentucky Cycle,” by Robert Schenkkan, which had been developed in part at the Taper, and which also won a Pulitzer.Mr. Davidson’s many credits as a director and producer at the Taper also included Neil Simon’s “ I Ought to Be in Pictures” (1981), Lanford Wilson’s “Burn This” (1987) and the musical “Jelly’s Last Jam” (1992), which had its premiere at the Taper, with George C. Wolfe, who wrote the book, directing.In 1989 Mr. Davidson was named artistic director of the 2,100-seat Ahmanson Theater, which, like the Mark Taper Forum, operates under the umbrella of the Center Theater Group, a nonprofit regional theater company that evolved from the U.C.L.A. Theater Group. After supervising the renovation of the theater, he reopened the Ahmanson in 1995 with a revival of “Candide.”Before retiring in early 2005, Mr. Davidson directed the world premiere of “QED” (2001), Peter Parnell’s play about the physicist Richard Feynman, starring Alan Alda. Developed at the Taper, it was later staged at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center.When Mr. Davidson announced his retirement in 2002, Mr. Eustis summed up his achievement succinctly. Mr. Davidson, he told The Los Angeles Times, “has managed to make serious theater in the eye of the celebrity hurricane.”
