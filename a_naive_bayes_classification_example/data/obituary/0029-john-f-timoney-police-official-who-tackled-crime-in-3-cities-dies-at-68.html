John F. Timoney, a blunt Irish-born cop who could outrun crooks and quote Yeats and who, as a ranking police official in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, plotted innovative strategies that helped reverse years of skyrocketing crime, died on Tuesday in Miami. He was 68.The cause was complications of lung cancer, his brother, Ciaran, said. Mr. Timoney was living in Miami and died in a hospital there.A Bronx street kid with an antipathy toward the police, Mr. Timoney grew up to become, at 46, the youngest chief of department in New York, holding the city’s top uniformed post, as the third in command, in 1994, and later becoming commissioner in Philadelphia and chief in Miami.Mr. Timoney presided over decreases in crime in all three cities. He was responsible for imposing protocols that typically reduced the number of shootings by the police and other kinds of violent confrontations with civilians. And he shifted priorities from summons quotas and radio car patrols to shoe-leather crime prevention and enforcement.“Timoney came here with this really bizarre idea,” Capt. Tom Nestel of the Philadelphia Police Department told The Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine in 1999, “the idea that the police should be doing police work.”Prof. George L. Kelling, a criminologist who, with James Q. Wilson, originated the so-called broken-windows policing strategy, has credited Mr. Timoney with helping to reduce crime in New York and bring homicides under control in Philadelphia. “And he demonstrated in Miami that he could reduce police shootings without endangering officers or allowing crime to increase,” Professor Kelling said.Under Mr. Timoney’s watch, the number of uniformed officers in New York grew to more than 37,000 and the number of murders plunged by nearly half. In Philadelphia, where he commanded a force of 7,000, the number of murders dropped below 400 for the first time in 16 years. In Miami, where he was sworn in as 11 officers accused of covering up police shootings went on trial, a full 20 months passed without a single bullet being fired by police officers at a civilian.Mr. Timoney was a swaggering cop, straight out of central casting, with a Bronx brogue.“He walked on his toes, like James Cagney in ‘Yankee Doodle Dandy,’ like a hoofer or a fighter in the ring,” William J. Bratton, who was the New York police commissioner from 1994 to 1996 and will end his second run as commissioner next month, wrote in his 1998 book, “Turnaround: How America’s Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic” (with Peter Knobler). “He was the N.Y.P.D. personified. He was my rock.”In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Bratton said, “He was an integral part of the turnaround, and his legacy is the safest city that he left behind.”According to legend, the author Tom Wolfe wrote, “Timoney never once had to draw a weapon to arrest a felon and take him in. He just gave him a good look at ... that face ... and even the most obtuse and poisonous viper became a mewling little pussy.”(Mr. Wolfe acknowledged, though, in the foreword to Mr. Timoney’s 2010 memoir, “Beat Cop to Top Cop: A Tale of Three Cities,” that the folkloric face was insufficient to cow two drug dealers with whom Mr. Timoney once engaged in a shootout.)John Francis Timoney (known to his family as Sean) was born on July 2, 1948, in Dublin, the son of Ciaran Timoney and the former Catherine Kenny. The family immigrated to New York in 1961, when he was 12 and settled in the Washington Heights section of Upper Manhattan.His father worked briefly as a doorman but died of cancer in 1966, the year John graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx. To support the family, his mother washed dishes at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington Heights while accepting help from Catholic Charities. That same year, she and John’s sister returned to Ireland, leaving him and Ciaran, his younger brother, to live on their own.Mr. Timoney passed the police exam that summer, but because he had not yet turned 21 he spent 18 months as a trainee before being assigned to the 44th Precinct in the South Bronx.While serving there, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree from John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of New York, in 1971, and earned a master’s from Fordham University. Both degrees were in American history. (He received a second master’s, in urban affairs, in 1981 from Hunter College.) He also taught history at Westchester County high schools.Besides his brother, he is survived by his wife, the former Noreen Carroll; their children, Christine and Sean; his sister, Marie Nash; and two granddaughters.Mr. Timoney rose meteorically through the New York ranks. His mentors, he said, were three commissioners: Benjamin Ward, the city’s first black police commissioner; Raymond W. Kelly, under whom he served as commander of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, the department’s think tank; and Mr. Bratton, who promoted him over 16 senior officers to the rank of four-star chief, in 1994, and, a year later, to first deputy commissioner.As an administrator, he made domestic violence and school truancy police priorities after scrutinizing the department’s responses and their consequences.Explaining the department’s policy banning chokeholds, Mr. Timoney told The New York Times in 1993: “We are in the business of protecting life, not taking it. We’re in the business of officer safety. The bottom line of the whole thing is that if somebody is emotionally disturbed, they really need police help, and we should render it in the most humane and professional way possible.”He would hammer that point home to rookie officers with the story of a former partner who was convicted of homicide for beating a robbery suspect to death in 1975, while Mr. Timoney was on vacation. Other officers had failed to intervene.“There comes a time when that person is under control, where the cuffs are on, that the force stops, right?” he said. “And if you see your partner or another officer start to lose their heads and look for that extra shot, you gotta pull ’em off. That’s part of your job. And you’re doing it not to just stay out of jail. You do it because it’s morally right.”He later acknowledged what he considered the role of race in police shootings, including that of Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant, who was shot 41 times by officers in the Bronx in 1999. “If Amadou Diallo was an immigrant from Belfast, Ireland, he’d be alive today,” Mr. Timoney said in an Esquire magazine article in 2000.When Mr. Bratton resigned in 1996 after a falling out with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Bratton recommended Mr. Timoney to succeed him. Mr. Giuliani instead chose his fire commissioner, Howard Safir, whom Mr. Timoney dismissed as a “lightweight” — although he called him the next day to apologize.“Plans? I have none,” Mr. Timoney said when asked what he would do next. “I hope I have left some bridges unburned.”He was recruited to lead the police in Philadelphia in 1998 by that city’s mayor, Edward G. Rendell, who would later become governor of Pennsylvania. Mr. Timoney also helped reduce crime there, though he feuded with the police union and was criticized as overzealous in containing protesters at the 2000 Republican National Convention (while riding herd on a bicycle).While jogging in Rittenhouse Square during his first week on the job — he had completed a New York marathon in four hours, eight minutes — he caught a purse snatcher. The Inquirer called his departure in January 2002 “a monumental loss.”He was received in Miami, where he was hired to head its 1,200-member force in 2003, in much the same way: a no-confidence vote by the police union, alongside reductions in crime and in complaints of police abuse during his seven-year tenure.To Miami police officers who demanded an exception to his policy that they could no longer shoot at cars, he granted just one: if he arrived at the scene and found an officer had a tire track across his chest.When Mr. Bratton held his first retreat for executive officers in 1994, the newly promoted Mr. Timoney appeared before the city’s police leaders and audaciously proclaimed what is widely accepted today.As Tom Junod wrote in the Esquire article, he said his colleagues “were wrong, and had been wrong all along, the last 25 years, for they had built an entire organization on the probability of failure when they ought to have built one on the possibility of success.”“They were reacting,” Mr. Junod added, “when they should have been anticipating; they were out containing crime when they should have been attacking it; they were out cleaning up dead bodies when they should have been out saving lives.”
