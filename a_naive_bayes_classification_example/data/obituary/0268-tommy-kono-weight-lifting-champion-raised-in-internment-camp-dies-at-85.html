Tommy Kono, who learned weight lifting as a frail youngster in a Japanese-American detention camp during World War II and went on to be recognized as one of the greatest lifters of all time, winning two Olympic gold medals and holding numerous records, died on Sunday in Honolulu. He was 85.The cause was hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis, his daughter, JoAnn Sumida, said.Kono won his first gold medal at the Helsinki Games in 1952 and won world or Olympic championships every year until 1960, when he took the silver medal in Rome. In the 1950s and ’60s, he set numerous world records — 26 by his own count, although the International Weightlifting Federation lists 20. (Artie Drechsler of USA Weightiftling said in a tribute to Kono this week that because “there were instances of records for which paperwork was never filed” in those years, he suspected that Kono’s figure was accurate.)Standing only 5-foot-6, Kono competed in four different weight classes over the years and was the only lifter to set world records in all of them. He set records as a lightweight (for which the maximum at the time was 148.5 pounds), middleweight (165), light heavyweight (181) and middle heavyweight (198). He won his first Olympic gold as a lightweight; his second, in Melbourne in 1956, as a light heavyweight; and his silver as a middleweight.His varying weight was in large part a matter of strategy. In 2000, the journal Physical Training, noting the intense competition in sports between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, wrote: “Kono competed at whichever of three different weights offered the U.S. the greatest opportunity of defeating the Soviets. The way Kono added weight was by eating six or seven meals a day. To lose weight, he simply cut back to three.”He was elected to the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1990 and the International Weightlifting Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2005, at a ceremony on the 100th anniversary of its founding, the International Weightlifting Federation named him “Lifter of the Century.”Kono, who had success as a bodybuilder as well, was also a role model for a future bodybuilding champion (and movie star, and governor of California) named Arnold Schwarzenegger, who saw him take part in the Mr. Universe competition in Vienna in 1961. In 2005 Kono told The Sacramento Bee, “He told me he was a 13-year-old boy in the audience that day and was so inspired he ran home and started working out.”Kono won that competition. It was the third time he had won Mr. Universe, the other titles having come in 1955 and 1957. He also won the Mr. World competition in 1954.Tamio Kono was born on June 27, 1930, in Sacramento, to Kanichi and Ishimi Kono. His father owned a printing company. When he was a boy, he had such severe asthma that he missed a third of his classes and all of his physical education training.At age 11, he stood just over 4 foot 8 and weighed about 75 pounds. Eager to be stronger, he sent a postcard for information on the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course. But he did not enroll because he could not afford the course, which cost $36.Kono began lifting weights under less than auspicious circumstances: at the Tule Lake internment center in Northern California, where in 1942 he and his family were among the 120,000 Japanese-Americans relocated inland from the Pacific Coast. The dry desert air relieved his asthma, and when he was 14, a neighbor at the camp gave him a 15-pound barbell and introduced him to Olympic-style lifting.At first he trained in secret, because his parents worried that his frail frame could not handle the strain. By the time the Kono family was released in 1945, he had gained about 15 pounds of muscle.“I didn’t want to be a weight lifter,” Kono recalled in 1960. “I just wanted to be healthy.”In 1948, as a high school senior in Sacramento, he competed for the first time and finished second. (There were only two lifters in his weight class.) Two years later, facing considerably more competition, he placed second in the national championships in New York. He studied mechanical engineering at Sacramento Junior College (now Sacramento City College) and in 1951 was drafted into the Army, where he was made an athletic instructor and given time to train and compete.After turning down a lucrative offer to be one of the bodybuilders featured in Mae West’s Las Vegas revue, he went to work for the California Highway Department.Kono retired from weight lifting shortly after a knee injury kept him out of the 1964 Olympics. He later coached the Olympic lifting teams for three different countries: Mexico in 1968, West Germany in 1972 and the United States in 1976.In 2012, Kono explained his coaching philosophy to The New Yorker: “Weight lifting is 50 percent mental and 30 percent technique. Power is only 20 percent, but everybody has it reversed.”Kono worked as a physical fitness specialist for the City of Honolulu for more than 20 years. After retiring in 1997, he continued to lift weights three days a week.In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Florence Rodrigues, whom he married in 1963; two sons, Jamieson and Mark; and three grandchildren.Kono was revered in the Soviet Union, where weight lifting was a major sport. In 1958, the Soviets paid his way to a competition in Moscow, which he won. As thanks for his visit, they gave him 18 pounds of classical records and art books and paid the airline’s $104 overweight charge on his luggage.Fyodor Bogdanovsky, a frequent Soviet rival, summed up the feelings of Kono’s opponents.“When Kono looks at me from the wings,” Bogdanovsky once said, “he works on me like a python on a rabbit.”
