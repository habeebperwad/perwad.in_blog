James M. Nederlander, who, with mercenary guile and an admittedly plebeian aesthetic, presided for nearly half a century over a theater empire that encompassed as many as 10 houses on Broadway and stretched across the country to California and across the Atlantic to London, died on Monday in Southampton, N.Y. He was 94.His death was confirmed by Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization.Mr. Nederlander (pronounced NEE-der-lan-der), chairman of the organization, an entertainment company that presented arena concerts as well as theatrical shows, began with the purchase of a single New York theater, the Palace on Broadway, in 1964, and rose to become a legitimate rival to the powerful Shuberts.The dimensions of the company’s holdings have shifted over the years, but the Nederlander Organization currently owns or operates nine Broadway theaters — in addition to the Palace, they are the Brooks Atkinson, Gershwin, Lunt-Fontanne, Marquis, Minskoff, Nederlander, Neil Simon and Richard Rodgers — two in Detroit, one in Los Angeles, four in Chicago and three in London, as well as others in San Diego, San Jose, Calif., Tucson, Durham, N.C., Charleston, S.C., and a concert hall in Anaheim, Calif.One of five brothers who entered the family business started by their father (he also had a sister), Mr. Nederlander was often referred to as Broadway’s last patriarch. Theater people called him Jimmy when they were talking to him and Senior when they were talking about him, to distinguish him from his son, James L. Nederlander, who is the longtime president of the Nederlander Organization.Unlike many in the theater, Mr. Nederlander never disguised his profit motive with a glorification of art. No one ever accused him of pretentiousness, as they sometimes did his chief rivals, Bernard B. Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld, the longtime leaders of the Shubert Organization. Nor would anyone ever think to nominate him to lead the National Endowment for the Arts, as Rocco Landesman, who formerly headed Broadway’s other significant multitheater owner, Jujamcyn Theaters, was asked to do by President Obama in 2009.Not that Mr. Nederlander was averse to classical or original theater. Frequently a producer of shows as well as the theater owner, he presented troupes including the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Bolshoi Ballet; Ibsen’s “Ghosts” and Pinter’s “Betrayal,” and “The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,” David Edgar’s adaptation, a two-part, eight-hour marathon, of Dickens’s novel.He once said that “Copenhagen,” Michael Frayn’s dramatic disquisition on quantum physics (whose 2001 national tour was produced by Mr. Nederlander and others) was one of his favorite dramas. Stephen Sondheim’s darkly boisterous musical “Sweeney Todd” made its Broadway debut in a Nederlander house.But he did have an aversion to plays about disaster and disease (he turned down “The Elephant Man,” for example, and disapproved when his niece Amy Nederlander helped produce a 1997 revival of “The Diary of Anne Frank”), and it’s fair to say that too much speechifying onstage made him impatient. John Breglio, a veteran theater lawyer and producer, recalled that in 1988, when Glenda Jackson played Lady Macbeth on Broadway, he had a conversation with Mr. Nederlander at intermission.“We were walking up the aisle, and I said, ‘Wow, Jimmy, great play, eh?’” Mr. Breglio said in a 2009 interview. “And he said, ‘Yeah, but Jesus, it’s talky.’”His stated preference was for broad-based popular entertainment, especially musicals, often with familiar titles and recognizable stars. “Sweet Charity” (1966) with Gwen Verdon; “Annie” (1977); “The Will Rogers Follies” (1991) with Keith Carradine; Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Sunset Boulevard” (1994) with Glenn Close; “Saturday Night Fever” (1999); “Movin’ Out” (2002), the Billy Joel-Twyla Tharp dance musical; “Wicked” a twist on “The Wizard of Oz,” based on a novel by Gregory Maguire, which opened in 2003 at the Gershwin and is still there; “Hairspray” (2002), and “In the Heights” (2008), Lin-Manuel Miranda’s first Tony-winning show: All appeared in Nederlander houses on Broadway.Mr. Miranda’s megahit “Hamilton” is in one now, the Rodgers on West 46th Street, where it is likely to remain for a long time.The myriad revivals that appeared in Nederlander houses included “The King and I” in 1977 with Yul Brynner; “Hello, Dolly!” in 1978 with Carol Channing; “Man of La Mancha” (1992) with Raul Julia; “Camelot” (1993) with Robert Goulet; “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” (1995) with Matthew Broderick; “Annie Get Your Gun” (1999) with Bernadette Peters (and later Reba McEntire), and “Fiddler on the Roof” (2004) with Alfred Molina (and later Harvey Fierstein).Mr. Nederlander frequently filled dark nights in his Broadway theaters with concert performances or short-run solo shows by the likes of Patti LaBelle, Shirley Bassey, Smokey Robinson, Kenny Rogers, Barry Manilow, Joan Jett and Rodney Dangerfield.The Nederlander Organization’s Broadway houses are not exactly the theaters of legend. They are mostly big and barnlike — the Gershwin, the Minskoff, the Marquis — or else they are oddly shaped, like the shoebox Lunt-Fontanne, or out of the way, like the Nederlander on West 41st Street, and the company was not always known to give them the spit-and-polish care that the Shuberts lavished on the showcase theaters on and around West 45th Street.The theaters were sometimes victims of spotty upkeep, a kind of seediness that finally worked in the company’s favor when “Rent,” Jonathan Larson’s musical set in a seedy downtown neighborhood, opened in 1996 in the long-neglected Nederlander (formerly the Billy Rose and, briefly, the Trafalgar), a match of setting and venue that helped a much-ballyhooed show run for a dozen years.In 1989, during an especially lackluster period on Broadway, Mr. Nederlander leased perhaps his most elegant property, the Mark Hellinger Theater on 51st Street and Broadway, home to the original “My Fair Lady,” to the Times Square Church, saying that when the lease was up he would return it to theatrical use. But he sold the theater to the church in 1991, a move still bitterly lamented by some producers today.“I wish he hadn’t sold that great theater,” said James B. Freydberg, a veteran producer. “That’s not the theater business. That’s the real estate business.”All of this contributed to the Nederlander Organization’s reputation as, unkindly expressed, a Broadway used-car lot or, less unkindly, an economy shop. It wasn’t a reputation Mr. Nederlander necessarily cared to combat. He had a handful of favorite tenets that he would sprinkle about liberally in interviews:There are no bad theaters, he would say, only bad shows.We’re in the moving business, he would say; we move ’em in and we move ’em out.He disdained anyone who claimed the ability to predict which shows would be hits and which would be flops; he kept the posters of his own flop shows — “The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public,” “Legs Diamond,” “Nick and Nora,” “Shogun: The Musical” — on the wall of his office bathroom.“They had to be not just failures, but failures of note,” Mr. Scandalios said in an interview on Tuesday.And yet Mr. Nederlander maintained good relations with most producers; theater people respected him and liked him. He was given a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2004.“He was honest and decent,” Mr. Breglio said. “If he didn’t like something he’d tell you. There was no duplicity there, and only one agenda: putting moneymaking shows in theaters.”James Morton Nederlander was born in Detroit on March 31, 1922, the third of six children of David T. Nederlander (known as D.T.),who started the family business in 1912 by acquiring the lease on the old Detroit Opera House.A diminutive man — he was 5-foot-5 — with a shrewd business sense, the elder Mr. Nederlander was known for a tough-minded resistance to the demands of actors, producers and unions, and for an acerbic wit. Once, when the actress Constance Bennett was performing in one of his theaters in Detroit, she complained about noise in the alley outside her dressing room.“All right, I’ll move the alley for you,” he said.Young James attended the Detroit Institute of Technology — he intended to be a lawyer — but he was broke and began a theater apprenticeship, going to work in the box office of the Shubert Theater in Detroit, owned by his father, for $25 a week.He served stateside in the Army Air Forces in World War II, during which he made his first stop on Broadway, working on “Winged Victory,” the patriotic show written by Moss Hart that was commissioned and produced by the Army Air Forces. After the war — and especially after the government loosened the stranglehold of the Shubert Organization on the business of live theater, forcing the Shuberts to relinquish control of theaters in several cities, including Detroit — he helped expand the Nederlander empire, opening theaters in Toledo, Minneapolis and Chicago.“When you’re blue, they buy you lunch; when you’re broke, they lend you money,” the producer Alexander H. Cohen told The New York Times in 1970 about the Nederlander way of doing business. “But they’re not pushovers. They expect loyalty and demand respect. They get both.”At the same time they were a clan often involved in internecine battles, with marital discord seemingly the rule rather than the exception. The brothers’ wives tended not to like one another and to say so, occasionally in the newspaper.Mr. Nederlander’s nephew Eric found himself in the middle of a tabloid feast when he married a woman named Jessica Sklar, who deserted him almost immediately thereafter for Jerry Seinfeld. And Mr. Nederlander himself married his first wife, the former Barbara Smith, twice and separated often from his second wife, the former Charlene Saunders, whom he married in 1969.“The separations usually last one or two months, and so far Charlene has made the first overtures to come back; you can quote me on that,” Mr. Nederlander told The Times in 1983. He added, “I’m happy when she does.”Mr. Nederlander had homes in Southampton, Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.In addition to his wife and his son, he is survived by two brothers, Joseph and Robert, a stepdaughter, Kristina Gustafson; two grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.“The thing people didn’t know about Jimmy is he was generous; he took care of people,” said Emanuel Azenberg, a producer who worked on numerous shows with Mr. Nederlander. He loved the business part of the business, Mr. Azenberg said, made no bones about his middling aesthetic standards and went with his gut where his money was concerned.“If you needed a million dollars he might give it to you,” Mr. Azenberg said. “If you needed a $10 raise, it was ‘Why?’”
