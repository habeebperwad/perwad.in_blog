When Gardnar Mulloy was 9 years old or so, his father and uncle built a clay court in the backyard of the family home in Miami. The boy swatted tennis balls with them, then found players his own age at a local park. He was still at it in his 90s, playing senior tournament tennis, having long outlasted his opponents from the days when he was one of the most brilliant doubles players of his time.Over the years he won more than 125 national tournaments, most of them in senior play, a cause he championed.“We talk of tennis as a lifetime sport,” the Hall of Famer Tony Trabert once said of Mulloy. “He’s living proof.”Mulloy died on Monday night in Miami, his longtime hometown, his wife, Jacqueline, said. He had been ailing since a stroke three years ago.  At 102 he was the oldest member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.Mulloy won four men’s doubles titles at the United States Nationals long before the advent of the Open era, when amateurs could play with pros, and at 43 he became the oldest player to win a men’s doubles title at Wimbledon.He was ranked No. 1 in the United States in 1952 at age 38 after reaching the singles finals in the Nationals at Forest Hills, losing to 24-year-old Frank Sedgman of Australia, the defending champion. From 1939 to 1954, Mulloy was ranked in the top 10 nationally in singles every year except for two, when he was in the Navy.He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1972.Tall and handsome, nicknamed the Silver Fox by the comedian Alan King for his shock of white hair, witty and outspoken, Mulloy had much to look back on when he was top-ranked in senior play.His most memorable achievement came in the Wimbledon doubles in 1957, when he teamed with 33-year-old Budge Patty in an unseeded duo that stunned the top-seeded Australians Lew Hoad, 22, and Neale Fraser, 23, in four sets.Mulloy was “the master strategist in the staggering American victory” for mixing lobs with sharply angled shots, the tennis writer Fred Tupper wrote in The New York Times.The Mulloy-Patty victory came on a day that resonated beyond the world of sports. Althea Gibson, who had reached the Wimbledon mixed doubles final a year earlier, playing with Mulloy, defeated Darlene Hard in the final of the women’s singles, becoming the first black player to capture a Wimbledon championship.A strong volleyer and adept at smashes, Mulloy teamed with Bill Talbert to capture the United States Nationals men’s doubles title in 1942, ’45, ’46 and ’48. He combined with Talbert to win the clinching point in the United States’ Davis Cup final victory over Australia at Forest Hills in 1948. He also played on Davis Cup-winning teams in 1946 and ’49.Mulloy’s Spartan lifestyle was legendary. He did not drink or smoke, and he largely confined his diet to vegetables, fruit and milk — a regimen that went back to his childhood, when his mother, Clara, an artist and dietitian and a descendant of Israel Putnam, one of George Washington’s generals, enforced healthy eating at home.“People come to me and say, ‘What fun do you have?’ ” Mulloy told The Times in 2005, a reference to his straight-arrow lifestyle. “I say: ‘I have a lot of fun. I don’t have any hangovers. My fun is clean living and enjoying the sunset and sunrise.’ ”Gardnar Putnam Mulloy was born on Nov. 22, 1913, in Washington. His family moved to Miami when he was a small boy. His father, Robin, was in the lumber business.Mulloy starred on his high school tennis team and played quarterback for the football squad. He received a football scholarship to the University of Miami but saw little action on game days.“I finally went to the president of the university and said: ‘I’m too skinny. I’m getting beat up and my father doesn’t like it,’ ” he once told The Associated Press. Mulloy asked the president why Miami did not have a tennis team and was told he could start one. And so he did, while also competing for the university’s boxing team.He also coached the tennis team and recruited Pancho Segura to play for it, having discovered him at a tournament in his native Ecuador. Segura, who enrolled at Miami although he could not produce evidence that he had graduated from high school, won three consecutive N.C.A.A. singles championships, from 1943 to 1945, and became one of the leading amateur and pro players of his time.After receiving his bachelor’s degree from Miami, Mulloy obtained a law degree there in 1938. Robin and Gardnar Mulloy won three national father-and-son championships before Gardnar became a Navy officer, commanding landing ships in the North African and Mediterranean invasions of World War II.Mulloy once described himself as a “brash American.”As he told it in his 2009 memoir, “As It Was,” he once met Princess Elizabeth, the future British monarch, at a garden party while playing in one of his early Wimbledon tournaments and asked her why he had not seen her in the Royal Box. When a member of the princess’ party said she had other duties to attend to, he responded, as if he were speaking directly to the princess, “‘Oh, I thought perhaps you weren’t able to get tickets, which I would be happy to provide.’ ”In her first visit to Wimbledon as the successor to her father, King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II presented the doubles trophies to Mulloy and Patty for their stunning upset victory of 1957.“After bowing and receiving my cup from the queen,” Mulloy recalled in his memoir, “I asked her if she remembered me.”Her response: “Yes, Mr. Mulloy, I remember you quite well. As a matter of fact, I had difficulty getting in today, as you forgot to leave me tickets.”Mulloy also recalled in the memoir, drawn in part on his first autobiography, “The Will to Win” (1960), how President Bill Clinton, peering through a fence, watched him play at a national senior event in Arlington, Va.Mulloy left the court in midmatch, he wrote, “to greet the president, who was standing with his Secret Service and golfing entourage.”“Upon introducing myself,” Mulloy continued, “I said, ‘Mr. President, you don’t know me, but I am Gardnar Mulloy, an admirer of yours.’ He replied, ‘I know who you are, and I have followed your career ever since I was a little boy.’ ”Mulloy’s response: “You are still a boy.”Mulloy was a strong advocate for expanding senior tennis from age 45 and up to age brackets extending to 90 and above. The Gardnar Mulloy Cup is awarded annually to the winner of a men’s 80-and-over international event.In his later years, aside from continuing to pursue senior tournament play, Mulloy was the director of tennis on Fisher Island in the Miami area and was active in animal rescue work.Besides his wife, the former Jacqueline Mayer, whom he married in 2008, Mulloy’s survivors include his daughters, Diane Mazzone and Janice Poindexter, both from his marriage to Madeleine Cheney, who died in 1993; a sister, Patricia Mahaffey; four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.Mulloy took issue with tennis officialdom when he felt it was too political or old-fashioned. He won a small victory in 2003 when he received a $250 check from the United States Tennis Association, making good on a Davis Cup debt from decades past.“That was for 1946, when we went to Australia to regain the cup,” he told The Boston Globe in 2003. “We were supposed to get 12 bucks a day for meals and some other incidentals. I submitted a bill for $250 and never got it. I kept submitting it — and this year it came through.”
