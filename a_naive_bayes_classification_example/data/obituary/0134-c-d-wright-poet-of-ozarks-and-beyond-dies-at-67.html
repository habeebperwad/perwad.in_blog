C. D. Wright, a MacArthur fellowship-winning poet whose work — characterized by linguistic experimentation, stylistic innovation and an ever-shifting thematic canvas — was rooted in her Southern heritage yet, at the same time, utterly beyond category, died this week at her home in Barrington, R.I. She was 67.The death, which occurred either late Tuesday or early Wednesday, was announced by her longtime publisher, Copper Canyon Press, which said that no cause had been determined. A past poet laureate of Rhode Island, Ms. Wright was at her death the Israel J. Kapstein professor of English and professor of literary arts at Brown University, where she had taught since 1983.Ms. Wright, whose work appeared in The New Yorker and elsewhere, was the author of more than a dozen volumes of verse. Among her best-known was “One With Others: [a little book of her days],” a book-length, quasi-documentary poem that won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2010.In its mix of the commonplace and the fantastic — and its dreamlike, fragmentary unpredictability — Ms. Wright’s poetry seemed to encapsulate the workings of human memory itself. By turns anecdotal and reportorial, sober and erotic, narrative and nonnarrative, it could assume collagelike form, assembled through quick, precisely placed jump cuts.In her poem “The Ozark Odes,” for instance, one section comprises no more than the curious, euphonious names of Arkansas towns. “Acorn/Back Gate/Bald Knob/Ben Hur,” it begins, and on it goes through “Eros/Fifty-Six/Figure Five” and “Flippen” to “Urbanette/Whisp/Yellville” and “Zent.”Ms. Wright’s language can range from the consciously quotidian to the self-reflectively baroque: “Limerance,” “neotenous,” “nulliparous” and “flensed” have all seeded her work. Her lines crackle with syntactic wit: Nouns and verbs can riot and tumble, or, when most keenly needed, be startlingly absent.The title of a recent collection, published just before Ms. Wright’s death — “The Poet, the Lion, Talking Pictures, El Farolito, a Wedding in St. Roch, the Big Box Store, the Warp in the Mirror, Spring, Midnights, Fire & All” — attests to the breadth of the poetic net she cast.In the opinion of many critics, Ms. Wright’s body of work is so uncategorizable that it defies even the category “Uncategorizable.”Reviewing her 2008 volume, “Rising, Falling, Hovering,” in The New York Times Book Review, the poet Joel Brouwer wrote, “Various aspects of her current style can be compared to the work of certain of her contemporaries, but considered holistically, Wright belongs to a school of exactly one.”It seemed fitting that Ms. Wright habitually pushed — and often broke — the formal restraints that can fetter poetry, for as she made clear in interviews, she considered the writing of poetry to be an act of social responsibility. If anything can be said to unite her diverse output, it is a pervasive undercurrent of humanism and an abiding concern with themes of liberation.“My poems are about desire, conflict, the dearth of justice for all,” she wrote in “hills,” the prose introduction to her 1986 collection, “Further Adventures With You.” “About persons of small means. They are succinct but otherwise orthodox novels in which the necessary characters are brought out, made intimate (that is, they reveal themselves), engage in dramatic action and leave the scene forever with or without a resolution in hand or sight.”In “One With Others,” which was also a finalist for a National Book Award, Ms. Wright memorializes a friend, a white Southern woman she calls V.A self-educated woman of threadbare means, V waded into the civil rights movement after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As a result, Ms. Wright wrote, she was ostracized in her town, her car burned and her seven children removed from her care by her husband.“The river rises from a mountain of granite,” Ms. Wright’s poem goes. It continues:The river receives the water of the little river.The house where my friend once lived, indefinitely empty.Walnuts turning dark in the grass. Papers collected on the porch.If I put my face to the glass, I can make out the ghostof her ironing board, bottle of bourbon on the end.In “One Big Self,” a collaboration with the photographer Deborah Luster, Ms. Wright married her own verse to words she elicited in interviews with inmates of three Louisiana prisons. In one passage, she wrote:AC or DCYou want to be Westinghoused or EdisonedYour pick you’re the one condemnedTennessee’s retired chair available on eBay.Carolyn Delores Wright was born on Jan. 6, 1949, in Mountain Home, Ark., in the southern Ozarks. Her father was a judge, her mother a court reporter.After earning a bachelor’s degree in French from Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis), she briefly attended law school at the University of Arkansas before thinking better of it and training her sights on poetry. She later earned a master of fine arts degree in creative writing from Arkansas.Ms. Wright’s early poems were suffused with a style of diction that she later self-knowingly described as “idiom Ozarkia.”“When I began to write seriously, I wrote strictly dialect with aberrant spelling, subject-verb disagreements,” she recalled in “hills.” “I wrote blue tick hounds accompanied by untunable git-tars and ocarinas.” She added:“While I prefer cornbread crumbled in buttermilk to sushi I do not write from my lost life alone, any more than I dictate every term by which I do write.”Ms. Wright’s survivors include her husband, the poet Forrest Gander, with whom she ran Lost Roads Press, a publisher of poetry and fiction, for many years; their son, Brecht; and a brother, Warren Wright.Ms. Wright was named a MacArthur fellow in 2004. Her other laurels include a Guggenheim fellowship and the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets.Among her other books are “Translations of the Gospel Back Into Tongues” (1982); “Just Whistle: A Valentine” (1993, with photographs by Ms. Luster); and “Tremble” (1996).In an autobiographical prose poem in her 2005 collection, “Cooling Time: An American Poetry Vigil,” Ms. Wright wrote about her vocation with the wanton verblessness to which perhaps only a poet is entitled.“I poetry,” she wrote. “I write it, study it, read it, edit it, publish it, teach it. ... Sometimes I weary of it. I could not live without it. Not in this world. Not in my lifetime. I also arkansas. Sometimes these verbs coalesce. Sometimes they trot off in opposite directions.”
