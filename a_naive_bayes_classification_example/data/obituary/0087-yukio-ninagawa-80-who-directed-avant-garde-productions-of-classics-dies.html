Yukio Ninagawa, a Japanese theater director who fused elaborate Kabuki with Western realism to mount original, critically acclaimed productions of classic Greek and Shakespearean plays in Europe and the United States as well as in his own country, died on May 12 in Tokyo. He was 80.The cause was complications of pneumonia, said the Ninagawa Studio, which he founded as a theater group and school.A failed painter and frustrated actor initially plagued by self-doubt, Mr. Ninagawa turned to directing when he was 30. He survived a stabbing in 1972 by a leftist who considered his motifs too frivolous, and committed himself to presenting avant-garde versions of timeless tragedies that resonated with current events.“If there are a thousand young men in the auditorium, I should expect a thousand knives,” he wrote in 1993 in a memoir, “A Thousand Knives, a Thousand Eyes,” a reference to the stabbing. “I thought I had to produce performances for those thousand knives.” (One of his early renderings of “Macbeth” was accompanied onstage by the sound of exploding tear gas grenades being lobbed by the police against demonstrators.)Outside Japan, Mr. Ninagawa collaborated with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Edinburgh Festival, the New York Shakespeare Festival and, as recently as last year, the Lincoln Center Festival.Critics were often reverential. Writing about the Ninagawa Company’s production of “The Tempest” in London in 1989, Michael Billington, the theater critic of The Guardian, proclaimed in The New York Times that the director generated “moments of pure magic” in a thrilling dramatization that demonstrated how Shakespeare’s play “not only can be accommodated to Oriental styles but also can become a complex meditation on the nature of theater itself.”Referring to the 15th-century Japanese style of musical drama, Mr. Billington wrote, “The Ninagawa Company proved that there is no business like Noh business.”In fusing two cultures, Mr. Ninagawa injected modern music, Buddhist imagery, indigenous Japanese flora and teeming spectacles into classic plays. Yet he remained faithful to the text, the scholar Kawai Shoichiro wrote in “The Routledge Companion to Directors’ Shakespeare” (2008), an authoritative collection of essays edited by John Russell Brown.“Throughout his career, his aim was not to reinterpret or to adapt Shakespeare’s play but to bring it in close rapport with the modern world and make it easier for his audiences — mainly Japanese — to understand, by means of visualization and Japanization,” Professor Shoichiro wrote.Mr. Ninagawa was born in Kawaguchi, a city in the greater Tokyo area, on Oct. 15, 1935. His father was a tailor. His mother often took him to the theater. He is survived by his wife, Hiroko, and his daughters, Mika and Mami.Mr. Ninagawa had hoped to become an artist in high school but failed the entrance exam for the Tokyo University of the Arts.When he was 20, he joined the Seihai theater company as a trainee actor. But when he left to start his own experimental companies and to act on television and in films, he found himself handicapped without a full-time director and wondered whether his own talent might lie more in directing.“To jolt himself out of self-doubt and inertia, Ninagawa wrote ‘Ninagawa Tensai’ (‘Ninagawa Genius’) on a nameplate and hung it on his apartment door,” the English-language edition of the Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported recently. “His reasoning was that if he proclaimed himself a genius, he would have to get cracking to prove he was the real deal. So he watched films and read books like a fiend and taught himself the art of stage directing.”He made his directorial debut in 1969, directed Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” in Japan for the first time in 1974 (accompanied by an Elton John rock score) and took his first production abroad — Euripides’ “Medea” — in 1983. That was followed by a production of “Macbeth,” which he took to the Edinburgh Festival in 1985 and to Central Park in the summer of 1986 as part of Joseph Papp’s New York Shakespeare Festival. He also staged a highly stylized all-male version of “Medea” in the park that summer.For his productions of “Macbeth” and “Medea” at the National Theater in London, Mr. Ninagawa was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award, Britain’s equivalent of the Tony, in 1987. (Declan Donnellan won for “The Cid,” “Twelfth Night” and “Macbeth” at the Donmar Warehouse.)Those performances were in Japanese, some with simultaneous English subtitles but others with no translations at all. Mr. Ninagawa said in the production notes to “Medea” that his goal was “to create a universal theater beyond the limits of age, nationality, language, customs and habits.”He took his production of “Macbeth” to the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1990. Bruce Weber wrote in The Times that while it was “the quickest three hours of Shakespeare you’ll ever see,” this version of “Macbeth,” with its overblown effects and gimmicks, “may have you thinking less about ambition, bloodshed, remorse and retribution than about Hollywood, MTV and the Hammacher Schlemmer catalog.”Also about mirrors. Many were used in Mr. Ninagawa’s “Macbeth” as props to capture real and virtual images that recall the duality of everyday life as the plot of destruction and death unfolds.“My perception of mortality is stronger than the last time I brought the play to New York,” Mr. Ninagawa told The Times in 2002. “I have come to understand that people learn about the world even by doing wrong. This is the mystery of human beings. Over time, I realize we must accept the bad with the good.”He added: “Growing old means that you physically become weak and your receptivity to new things may become weak, too. But there are new things in everyday life, and I always question whether I am picking up on them. If I realize that I cannot do that anymore, I have to quit.”
