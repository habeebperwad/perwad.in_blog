Robert Stigwood, the Australian-born producer, personal manager and music executive whose blockbuster hits with the Bee Gees and work on the films “Saturday Night Fever” and “Grease” made him one of the most successful impresarios of the 1970s, died on Monday. He was 81.Spencer Gibb, a son of Robin Gibb, one of the three brothers who made up the Bee Gees, confirmed the death in a Facebook post, calling Mr. Stigwood his godfather and “the longtime manager of my family,” but not saying where he died.For most of the 1970s, Mr. Stigwood had a golden touch in music, theater and film, recognizing early on the cross-promotional power of pop music and theatrical spectacle. He managed the Bee Gees and Eric Clapton, had producing credits on “Saturday Night Fever” (1977) and “Grease” (1978), and released multiplatinum soundtracks to those films on his label, RSO.Of the 19 singles that reached No. 1 on Billboard’s pop chart in 1978, eight were released by RSO —including several from the “Saturday Night Fever” album, among them the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive” and “Night Fever” and Yvonne Elliman’s “If I Can’t Have You.”RSO’s symbol, a red cartoon cow, became a ubiquitous pop-culture brand of the time, and Newsweek called Mr. Stigwood “the Ziegfeld of the disco age.” Sandy-haired and ruddy-cheeked, he lived his success as one of the music industry’s classic high-flying entrepreneurs, conducting business by yacht or from his homes in Bermuda, Beverly Hills and elsewhere around the world.He was a producer of the 1975 film “Tommy,” based on the Who’s concept album of the same title, and in 1971 produced “Jesus Christ Superstar” on Broadway, establishing its longhaired creators, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, as emergent auteurs of the rock-opera era.Mr. Lloyd Webber paid tribute to Mr. Stigwood on Twitter on Monday, calling him “the great showman who taught me so much.”Robert Colin Stigwood was born on April 16, 1934, in Adelaide, Australia. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother ran a nursing home. After working briefly as an advertising copywriter in Adelaide, Mr. Stigwood moved to London.In the early 1960s he started a talent agency for actors and made a deal with EMI, unusual at the time, as an independent record producer. In 1966 he became the manager of Cream, the rock supergroup that included Mr. Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, and was briefly associated with the Beatles. Brian Epstein, the Beatles’ manager, had merged his company with Mr. Stigwood’s, but after Mr. Epstein died in 1967 the group started its own company, Apple Corps, and Mr. Stigwood formed the Robert Stigwood Organization and its affiliated label, RSO. He also signed the Bee Gees, who had been child stars in Australia, shortly after their arrival in London in 1967, and promoted young pop stars like David Bowie and Rod Stewart.Mr. Stigwood’s theater ventures began in the late 1960s when he brought risqué Broadway hits like “Hair” and “Oh! Calcutta” to London. He continued to work in theater, producing Mr. Lloyd Webber and Mr. Rice’s “Evita” in London in 1978.To maximize income from the shows, Mr. Stigwood cracked down on unlicensed performances of “Jesus Christ Superstar” in the United States, including high school productions.In 1978, just as his empire appeared invincible, he stumbled with a film version of the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” starring the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and George Burns, which reportedly cost $12 million to make and another $6 million to market. It was pilloried by critics and was a disappointment at the box office. Sequels to “Saturday Night Fever” and “Grease” also flopped.In 1980, Mr. Stigwood suffered another setback when the Bee Gees sued him for $200 million, saying that he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract, and the two parties settled out of court and publicly reconciled.RSO continued to release records into the early 1980s, including the soundtracks to “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Fame,” but was eventually absorbed into the major PolyGram, now part of the Universal Music Group. In 1996, Mr. Stigwood was a producer of Alan Parker’s film version of “Evita.” In his later years the British news media frequently ranked him as one of the wealthiest people in Britain.Information on survivors was not immediately available.
