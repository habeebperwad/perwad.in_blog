Dr. Peter C. Nowell, who with a colleague discovered the first genetic defect proven to cause cancer, died on Dec. 26 in Newtown Square, Pa. He was 88.The cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, his daughter Kristin said.The finding, published in 1960, took cancer research in a new direction, leading to an extraordinary advance by other scientists three decades later: the drug Gleevec. For many patients, Gleevec transformed chronic myeloid leukemia from a fatal disease to a chronic one that can be kept under control for many years.Before the report, written by Dr. Nowell and David A. Hungerford, few scientists had believed that flawed genes could lead to cancer.“The notions of cancer were so bizarre,” said Dr. Mark I. Greene, the director of the Immunobiology and Experimental Pathology Division at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Nowell spent most of his career. “It was a total conundrum. There was no consistent theory at that time that was even recognized.”Dr. Nowell (pronounced NO-well) and Dr. Hungerford, who at the time was a graduate student at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, made a deceptively simple observation. They noticed that in diseased white blood cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, one of the 46 chromosomes — the structures that carry genes — was abnormally short. It came to be known as the Philadelphia chromosome.Dr. Nowell realized that the genetic change was important in the development of the cancer, and that tumors might arise from a single cell that had such a change.There was resistance to the idea at first, Dr. Nowell told PennCurrent, a university publication, in 1999. “Now, a lot of people didn’t want to believe that at the time,” he said, “because they preferred that cancer should result from changes that did not involve the genetic material of the cell, because it would be easier to reverse.”But, he added, “I wasn’t particularly concerned because it made sense to me, and so I just kept on working.”More than 10 years passed before advances in laboratory methods enabled another scientist, Dr. Janet D. Rowley, from the University of Chicago, to analyze the Philadelphia chromosome more deeply. She found that the shortened chromosome, No. 22, had exchanged genetic material with another chromosome, No. 9.This genetic swap, or translocation, had created a new gene that led cells to produce a hyperactive enzyme, which stimulated uncontrolled growth in white blood cells — the hallmark of leukemia. Gleevec, developed in the late 1990s and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, turns off the enzyme. It is also used for some other cancers.Later research by Dr. Rowley and others found many more translocations leading to cancer.In 1976, Dr. Nowell published a landmark article in the journal Science describing the stepwise evolution of tumors. In a statement that seemed to anticipate the current push toward personalized treatment for cancer, he wrote, “Each patient’s cancer may require individual specific therapy.”Dr. Nowell was also renowned for devising techniques that greatly enhanced researchers’ ability to study cellular genetics — particularly the use of a plant-based substance to stimulate cell division, which became an indispensable tool.“He did simple things that turned out to change everything,” Dr. Greene said.Dr. Greene said that Dr. Nowell had little interest in money or prestige and had turned down promotions — including a chance to become provost of the Penn medical school — because they would have taken him away from science and teaching.Dr. Nowell wrote 400 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and received many major awards for his research, including the Lasker Award, often called the American Nobel, in 1998.Peter Carey Nowell was born on Feb. 8, 1928, in Rose Tree, Pa., about 12 miles west of Philadelphia. He was the third of four children. His mother, the former Margaret Matlack, was a teacher and writer. His father, Foster, was an electrical engineer.Dr. Nowell attended Swarthmore High School, Wesleyan University and medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1952.In 1950 he married Helen Walker Worst, who supervised telephone ordering for Sears Roebuck. They had met in high school. The first of their five children, Sharon, was born in 1954 with severe disabilities from cerebral palsy.At the time, the Nowells were living in San Francisco, where Dr. Nowell, who had been drafted into the military, was studying the health effects of radiation at the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory. He joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty in 1956.Kristin Nowell said that her parents had cared for Sharon at home for 35 years, and that her father would get Sharon up in the morning before leaving for work and would feed her dinner and put her to bed at night.Unlike most scientists of his stature, Ms. Nowell said, her father rarely traveled to conferences, choosing instead to remain at home and share the care of Sharon with his wife.Sharon Nowell died of pneumonia in 2000. Dr. Nowell’s wife died in 2004.In addition to his daughter Kristin, he is survived by another daughter, Karen Nowell King; two sons, Timothy and Michael; a brother, Foster Nowell Jr.; and seven grandchildren.Jonni S. Moore, who trained in Dr. Nowell’s lab and is now a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, described Dr. Nowell in an interview as a generous mentor who, unlike most senior scientists, insisted that she not include his name on her scientific publications, so that she would get full credit for her work.He was unusual in his support for women in science, she said, and in urging his trainees to spend more time with their families rather than practically living in the lab.Dr. Moore said Dr. Nowell’s great strength was his ability to see the big picture in science and to think “outside the box.”“He would always say, ‘We made the boxes; biology did not,’ ” she said.Dr. Nowell and Dr. Hungerford (who died in 1993) more or less stumbled on the Philadelphia chromosome; at the time they were simply looking at leukemic cells.Today, Dr. Moore said, it would be difficult if not impossible to get funding for such open-ended research, and universities would probably discourage it because it lacks focus. The emphasis now is on highly structured research aimed at testing a specific hypothesis, and scientists are urged to find niches for themselves, she said.“Someone starting up with the same mind-set and approach that Peter Nowell had might not make it today,” Dr. Moore said. “And that’s scary for the future of science.”
