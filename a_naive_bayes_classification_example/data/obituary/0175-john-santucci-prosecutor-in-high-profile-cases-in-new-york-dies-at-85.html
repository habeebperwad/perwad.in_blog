John J. Santucci, who as the Queens district attorney from 1977 to 1991 became a lightning rod of controversy in high-profile cases involving a fatal racial attack, a municipal corruption scandal and allegations of lethal police brutality, died on Sunday in Mineola, N.Y. He was 85.His death was confirmed by a grandson, John T. Santucci.Mr. Santucci gained wide attention in December 1986 after one of the most explosive racially motivated crimes in the city at the time — an attack on three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, by a gang of white teenagers, who chased one man onto a highway, where he was struck and killed by a car.The two other men and their lawyers refused to cooperate with Mr. Santucci’s office, contending that it had joined in an attempt to cover up vital aspects of the episode. Mr. Santucci denied the accusation, but he said that with the case at an impasse he had no choice but to turn it over to a specially appointed state prosecutor.That prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, who later became Brooklyn’s district attorney, won manslaughter convictions against three of the attackers, while six others were convicted of lesser charges.Earlier in 1986, Mr. Santucci had been both praised and pilloried in connection with a corruption scandal involving allegations of bribery schemes at city agencies.One defendant was John A. Zaccaro, the husband of Geraldine A. Ferraro, who had been an assistant district attorney under Mr. Santucci before she was elected to Congress and became the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1984. Another was Francis X. Smith, the state’s judicial administrator in Queens and a former president of the New York City Council, who had been a longtime friend of Mr. Santucci’s.Mr. Santucci prosecuted Mr. Zaccaro on charges that he had joined the Queens borough president, Donald R. Manes, in trying to extort a bribe from a cable television company that had unsuccessfully sought a franchise in Queens. Mr. Santucci prosecuted Mr. Smith on perjury charges for his grand jury testimony about meetings and conversations that were said to have been part of the extortion attempt.Mr. Zaccaro was acquitted; Mr. Smith was convicted and served two months in jail.Mr. Santucci’s supporters said the prosecutions showed that he had not let personal relationships keep him from doing his job. But Ms. Ferraro denounced Mr. Santucci, contending that he had prosecuted her husband only to burnish his image and share the spotlight in an investigation that had been begun by federal prosecutors.Indeed, some of Mr. Santucci’s critics maintained that his office had been lax in investigating political corruption in Queens. They noted that Mr. Manes was a central figure in the bribery plots that had been exposed by the federal prosecutors, headed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Manes committed suicide before he could be prosecuted.Mr. Santucci disputed the accusation of laxity. He said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987 that he had investigated separate allegations of payoffs to Mr. Manes before the 1986 scandal, but that he had been unable to make a case. In any event, he hired a special assistant, Paul W. Pickelle, a prosecutor from Westchester County without ties to the Queens establishment, to pursue cases related to Mr. Manes that were not being handled by Mr. Giuliani’s office.The resulting cable television cases, Mr. Santucci said in 1987, had caused him personal pain. “It was no fun for me with the Smith and Zaccaro indictments, especially Smith,” he said. “I knew Smith since 1958.”The rancorous case involving accusations of fatal police brutality began in 1991, when Mr. Santucci won the indictments of five police officers on murder charges. The officers said the victim, a car-theft suspect, had violently resisted arrest; prosecutors said one officer had choked the man.Some legal experts said the murder charges against the four other officers were a legal stretch. Mr. Santucci said they were warranted because all the officers had “acted in concert” and “all had some physical contact” with the suspect. Witnesses said the victim had been punched and kicked by the officers.But less than three months after the indictments, Mr. Santucci retired, in the middle of his fourth elected term, and his successor, Richard A. Brown, dropped all charges against the four other officers and reduced the charges against the one alleged to have done the choking to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The officer was acquitted of both charges at trial.The controversial episodes in Mr. Santucci’s tenure involved only a few of the thousands of investigations, plea deals and trials that cram the calendar of a big-city prosecutor’s office.“If you examine the totality of his work over 14 years, he’s run a fairly good office,” Thomas J. Manton, then a member of Congress and the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party, said when Mr. Santucci retired.Mr. Manton and others said that in some years Mr. Santucci’s office had the highest percentage of convictions in felony trials among the city’s district attorneys. And his office won convictions of police officers in another highly publicized case, involving the torture of drug suspects with an electric stun gun at a station house, in 1985.Some of the controversies swirling around Mr. Santucci had nothing to do with prosecutions. In 1986, news reports disclosed that three years earlier he had spent at least seven hours at a private luncheon with a group that included a businessman who the F.B.I. and the police said had ties to organized crime.Mr. Santucci responded that at the time of the luncheon he had not known this. He also said that those who made much of the matter were seeking to link him to organized crime because he was Italian-American.That Mr. Santucci would spend so much time with anybody at lunch did not surprise those who knew him. “He likes to talk, likes to schmooze, likes to be liked by everybody,” one aide said.John Joseph Santucci was born in Queens on April 2, 1931. He earned a law degree from St. John’s University and was an assistant district attorney in the borough from 1958 to 1964. He was later a member of the City Council for four years and a state senator for nine.Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed him district attorney for an interim one-year term beginning Jan. 1, 1977, to fill a vacancy. Mr. Santucci went on to be elected to four four-year terms of his own.He is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Edna Ann Hayes; three sons, Thomas, John Jr. and Robert; three daughters, Mary Panvini, Carol Santucci and Edna Masone; two brothers, Thomas, a cardiologist, and Fred, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court; and 12 grandchildren. He had homes in Garden City, N.Y., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.In 2014, Mr. Santucci’s family established the John J. Santucci Justice Scholarship at Touro Law School.Mr. Santucci initially envisioned the district attorney post as a steppingstone to higher office. In 1978, less than a year into his first full term, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for state attorney general. In 1980 he ran in his party’s primary for the United States Senate and lost. It was his last attempt at higher office.In the 1987 interview, Mr. Santucci said, “I never thought I’d be here 10 years.”
