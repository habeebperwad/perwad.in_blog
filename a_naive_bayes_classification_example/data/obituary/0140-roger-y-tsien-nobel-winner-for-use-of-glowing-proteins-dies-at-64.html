Roger Y. Tsien, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating a rainbow of fluorescent proteins that could light up the dance of molecules within cells, died on Aug. 24 in Eugene, Ore. He was 64.His death was announced by the University of California, San Diego, where he was a professor of chemistry and biochemistry. A university spokesman said that he did not have information about the cause, but that Dr. Tsien, who was visiting Eugene, had suffered a “medical event” while bicycling.While other scientists made the initial discoveries of a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish, Dr. Tsien (pronounced chen) was the one who transformed it into the ubiquitous tool used by biologists today.After another scientist, Douglas C. Prasher, provided a copy of the gene that encodes the fluorescent protein, Dr. Tsien set out to make a better version.“Roger, in his brilliant ingenuity, figured it should be possible to play with it,” Charles S. Zuker, a former colleague who is now at Columbia, said in an interview. “He would do the simplest, most clever experiments to get at some of the most fundamental questions in contemporary biology.”The original protein glowed green when ultraviolet or blue light was shined on it. Dr. Tsien and the other members of his laboratory mutated the gene so that the proteins glowed brighter under blue light, which made them easier for biologists to use. (Ultraviolet light damages living cells.)When biologists seek to track the comings and goings of a particular protein in a cell, they first identify the gene that produces it. They then splice the genetic instructions for the green fluorescent protein into the gene. The result is that the protein they want to track is tagged with a fluorescent snippet, a beacon easily visible under a microscope — as when a car’s headlights are turned on at night.Dr. Tsien’s laboratory then created a version that glowed blue instead of green. Other colors followed. That enabled the tracking of multiple molecules inside living cells.“It created a new universe of biology,” Dr. Zuker said.In 2008, Dr. Tsien shared the chemistry Nobel with Osamu Shimomura of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., and Boston University School of Medicine, who discovered the jellyfish protein, and Martin Chalfie, a professor of biological sciences at Columbia, the first to insert the green fluorescent protein gene into another organism.Dr. Tsien wondered why he had been honored and not Dr. Prasher, who had shared the gene with both Dr. Chalfie and Dr. Tsien.“I think it must have been an agonizing decision for the Nobel committee, and they could easily have given the prize to Doug instead of me,” Dr. Tsien told Chemistry World magazine.Dr. Prasher had by then dropped out of science and was driving a courtesy van for a Toyota dealership in Huntsville, Ala., after budget cuts cost him his job for a NASA subcontractor. But Dr. Chalfie and Dr. Tsien invited him to attend the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm and paid for his trip.In 2012, Dr. Tsien hired Dr. Prasher to work in his laboratory. Dr. Prasher left last year.Roger Yonchien Tsien was born on Feb. 1, 1952, in New York City, the third of three sons to Hsue Chu Tsien, a mechanical engineer, and Yi Ying, who was trained as a nurse. In an autobiographical essay on the Nobel Prize website, Dr. Tsien recalled that his parents bought him a chemistry set when he was in elementary school, but that he “didn’t find it very interesting because the experiments seemed so tame.”When he was 15, he worked at a summer research program at Ohio University. That turned into a project that won the top prize in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search competition.He entered Harvard at 16 and graduated with a degree in chemistry and physics in 1972. He earned a doctorate in physiology from the University of Cambridge in England in 1977.After positions as a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Tsien moved to the University of California, San Diego, in 1989.Building on research from his doctorate, he had developed a way to measure levels of calcium in cells, which was a marker for the level of activity in neurons. The markers changed shape in the presence of calcium ions and then would change color.“It’s typical of Roger,” said Stephen Adams, a scientist who worked in Dr. Tsien’s lab. “He took something that was well known in another field and applied it to neurobiology with a few chemical modifications.”Dr. Adams recalled that Dr. Tsien wanted to track other biological markers as well. Dr. Tsien and his collaborators extracted the proteins they wanted to track, attached dye molecules and injected them back into cells.It worked, but it was laborious.Dr. Tsien heard about the green fluorescent protein and found Dr. Prasher’s paper on the gene. Dr. Tsien and Dr. Chalfie independently contacted Dr. Prasher at about the same time.“He made it a much more powerful molecule for people to do their experiments with,” Dr. Chalfie said of Dr. Tsien’s work.Dr. Tsien, with Dr. Zuker, founded two companies in the 1990s. The Aurora Biosciences Corporation commercialized drug discovery tools using fluorescent markers, and Senomyx looked for ways to modulate taste receptors to reduce the amount of sugar in foods without affecting taste.Dr. Tsien is survived by his wife, Wendy; two brothers, Richard and Louis; and a stepson, Max Rink.After winning the Nobel, Dr. Tsien shifted his research again, although his work continued to be colorful. One project was a fluorescent molecule that would light up in neon green only in cancer tumors, telling surgeons exactly what to cut out and what to leave untouched. Another stains nerve cells, again to help surgeons avoid cutting them by mistake. The tumor indicators are in initial clinical trials; the nerve stain is being tested in animals.“We hope the combination of these molecules will significantly improve patient outcome,” said Dr. Quyen T. Nguyen, a professor of head and neck surgery at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, who was collaborating with Dr. Tsien.
