Clarence Reid, a soul singer, songwriter and producer who under the alias Blowfly was a proto-rap innovator and a leading light of American outsider music, thanks to decades of parody songs, sexual and scatological in nature, died on Jan. 17 in hospice care in Lauderdale Lakes, Fla. He was 76.His death was confirmed by Tom Bowker, his manager and musical collaborator, who said he had liver cancer and multiple organ failure.Mr. Reid led a sort of musical double life beginning in the mid-1960s. Under his birth name he was a mildly successful singer — one of his songs, “Nobody but You Babe,” went to No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 — and a well-known songwriter and producer on Miami’s rich soul scene.But as Blowfly he released more than two dozen albums — highlights include “Porno Freak,” “Blowfly’s Party” and “Blowfly for President” — tapping a seemingly bottomless well of juvenilia (and assorted other ilias, too).Clarence Henry Reid was born on Feb. 14, 1939, in the small town of Vienna, Ga., to Dock Reid and Annie Collins. Around age 7 he dropped out of school to pick cotton and wheat, sharecropping like his parents.Moving to Florida in the mid-1960s, he juggled menial jobs and a growing music career. He found his way to Deep City Records in Miami, where he worked as a staff songwriter. Around the same time, he pursued a solo singing career, though he met with only modest acclaim. Instead he found his rhythm as a songwriter and producer, eventually becoming the staff songwriter at TK Records, a prominent Miami label.Mr. Reid was the main writer on hits like Betty Wright’s “Clean Up Woman” and Gwen McCrae’s “Rockin’ Chair.” He helped shape the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band, which was influenced by the Caribbean junkanoo music that the group’s leader, Harry Wayne Casey, heard played at Mr. Reid’s wedding. He also wrote songs for soul stars like Sam & Dave and Wilson Pickett.Mr. Reid was such an adept that he was able to make convincing parodies, too. In 1971 he released an album of them, “The Weird World of Blowfly,” on his own Weird World label. On the cover he was a superhero in bodysuit and mask, a prelude to the increasingly ornate outfits he would wear during performances for decades.Blowfly was a loose-tongued character, but even though his subject matter was provocative, his early music was as disciplined as Miami’s mainstream soul; it was often played by the same musicians. Shock was his stock in trade: Just as a song began to feel familiar, he inserted his crazy lyrics, to uproarious effect.From early in his career, Mr. Reid mixed a kind of rhythmic talking into his music, borrowing the tempo of the patter he heard on black Southern radio stations. The results made him a kind of rap innovator, long before the genre had a commercial presence. In 1980 he released the gloriously raunchy “Rapp Dirty,” which he said he had written more than a decade earlier, and which became a touchstone for a future wave of profane, eccentric rappers.In both his parodies and his original compositions, Mr. Reid was lascivious but good-natured. Even at his most extreme, there was nothing harsh about him. While his songs painted him as a libertine and rascal, in real life he was religious — he had memorized the Bible, Mr. Bowker said — and rarely drank or did drugs.In an interview in the 2011 documentary “The Weird World of Blowfly,” directed by Jonathan Furmanski, Mr. Reid said he began making up his dirty songs as a child as a way of needling white people. “It backfired on me,” he said. “Everybody else wanted to please the crackers. I wanted to make ’em mad.” Instead, the very audience he wanted to annoy gave him money and, by extension, a career.As Blowfly, Mr. Reid created an implicitly radical counternarrative to the more polite strains of soul that were popular at the time. Blowfly’s music has been widely sampled, and his influence is heard, directly and indirectly, in the work of R. Kelly, 2 Live Crew, Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik and Weird Al Yankovic. Chuck D of Public Enemy, in the documentary, says “Rapp Dirty” was the inspiration for that group’s agit-rap hit “Fight the Power.”Mr. Reid struggled with finances in his later years. In 2003, he sold the rights to his publishing catalog to pay debts. “A million dollars tomorrow ain’t worth a damn if you can’t get $200 to live today,” he says in “Weird World.” In 2014, he raised money on a crowdfunding site to save his house from foreclosure.He is survived by his half-sisters, Virginia Bryant-Lawrence and Deborah Ann Williams; his half-brothers, John Richard Collins, Johnny Collins, Larry Collins, Floyd Collins, Tyrone Collins and Clarence Lamont Collins; two daughters, Carole Reid King and Tracy Reid; two sons, both named Clarence Henry Reid Jr.; and four grandchildren.A final album is scheduled for release next month. Neither its title nor those of about half of its songs are suitable for printing in this newspaper.
