Martin Friedman, who in three decades at the helm of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis transformed it from a sleepy local museum into a world-renowned setting for contemporary art, music, performance and dance, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.His death was announced by the museum, where he had served as director from 1961 to 1990. On moving to New York in ostensible retirement, Mr. Friedman oversaw the myriad art installations in Madison Square Park in Manhattan.Originally trained as a painter, Mr. Friedman was an ardent champion of Modernism, an equally ardent perfectionist and a skilled hand at courting benefactors — “a mixture,” Richard Eder wrote in The New York Times in 1976, “of professor, Puck and P. T. Barnum.”Over the years, Mr. Friedman’s highly benevolent despotism turned the Walker, Mr. Eder wrote, into “one of the finest modern-art museums in America.”At the museum, which grew out of the haphazard personal collection established in 1879 by Thomas Barlow Walker, a Minnesota lumber baron, Mr. Friedman oversaw a sea change that included the acquisition of works by major 20th-century artists, among them Marcel Duchamp and Isamu Noguchi; the commissioning of new work by emerging artists; the founding of the museum’s moving-image and performing-arts departments; the erection of a widely admired new building; and the creation of a landscaped sculpture garden awash in three-dimensional art, most conspicuously “Spoonbridge and Cherry,” by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen — an immense maraschino cherry on an even more immense spoon that remains a beloved totem of the city.In 2012, appraising Mr. Friedman’s tenure there, The New York Observer wrote, “If Minneapolis is the Paris of the Midwest, the Walker is its Louvre, d’Orsay and Eiffel Tower.”The son of Israel and Etta Friedman, a tailor and a homemaker, Martin Lee Friedman was born in Pittsburgh on Sept. 23, 1925. A gifted artist, he was studying to be a painter by the time he was in his teens.His undergraduate work at University of Pennsylvania was interrupted by naval R.O.T.C. service; he later finished his bachelor’s degree at the University of Washington. He went on to earn a master’s in studio art and art history from the University of California, Los Angeles.Concluding that he possessed insufficient talent to make it as a painter, Mr. Friedman taught art in the Los Angeles public school system before accepting a curatorial internship at the Brooklyn Museum in 1956.In 1958, he joined the Walker as a curator — the first curatorial job he ever held. Three years later, when he became its director, at 36, he was one of the youngest art museum directors in the nation.“My policy,” Mr. Friedman told Newsweek in 1990, “was to make it up as I went along.”What he made was a Modernist mecca.In the late 1960s, for instance, the Walker became the first museum to acquire a painting by a young artist named Chuck Close: a vast, unkempt, photorealistic self-portrait that Mr. Friedman bought from him for $1,300.During Mr. Friedman’s tenure, the museum also acquired work by Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Sol LeWitt, Robert Rauschenberg, William Wegman, Cindy Sherman and many other modern masters.Mr. Friedman oversaw every aspect of the Walker’s exhibitions: Before many an opening, he had staff members paint and repaint gallery walls at the 11th hour until they attained the precise shade of whiteness he saw in his mind’s eye.His efforts, in the view of many critics, paid dividends, and the museum soon became known for the dynamism of its installations, many of which toured nationally.Among the noteworthy exhibitions mounted by Mr. Friedman were “School of Paris 1959: The Internationals,” which featured new work by French abstract painters; “The Precisionist View in American Art” (1960), which included pieces by Stuart Davis, Georgia O’Keeffe and Charles Sheeler; and “De Stijl: 1917–1931, Visions of Utopia,” a 1982 installation assembled by Mr. Friedman’s wife, Mildred Friedman, the Walker’s curator of design.Not content to present art for the eyes alone, Mr. Friedman inaugurated the Walker’s esteemed performance-art programs, presenting luminaries like Nam June Paik, Laurie Anderson, Karen Finley and the Merce Cunningham Dance Company.What is now the Minnesota Opera had its start at the Walker in 1964, when the museum presented the world premiere of “The Masque of Angels,” an opera it had commissioned from the composer Dominick Argento.Before the first decade of Mr. Friedman’s directorship was out, he had grown dissatisfied with the Walker’s unwieldy 1927 neo-Moorish building, an uncongenial home for the avant-garde. He had it razed, and on its site erected a sleek modern edifice, designed by the eminent architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, which opened in 1971.Reviewing the building and its inaugural exhibition, “Works for New Spaces,” in The Times, Hilton Kramer wrote:“I suspect it is going to be one of those buildings that will change a lot of minds about what we can and should expect from the architects who design our new museums. For here, amazingly enough, is a new museum building that gives cheerful priority to the works of art it is meant to house.”Mr. Friedman, who especially adored sculpture, had long coveted an 11-acre plot of land near the museum, and in 1988 the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden opened there. Designed by Mr. Barnes, with landscape architecture by Peter Rothschild, it has drawn more than eight million visitors to date and includes art by Frank Gehry, Henry Moore, Louise Nevelson, Noguchi and George Segal.(Mr. Friedman became such a close associate of Mr. Segal that on more than one occasion the artist used him as the model for the plaster casts that were the basis of his life-size human sculptures, a process that entailed being mummified for a time in plaster-laced bandages.)After retiring from the Walker, Mr. Friedman was a consultant to museums around the country, in particular those planning sculpture gardens. In New York, he was the art adviser and curator for the Madison Square Park Conservancy, bringing in installations by LeWitt, Mr. Wegman, Mark di Suvero, Roxy Paine, Rachel Feinstein and others.Mr. Friedman’s wife, the former Mildred Shenberg, whom he married in 1949, died in 2014. His survivors include three daughters, Ceil Friedman, Lise Friedman and Zoe Melendez; and six grandchildren.His books include “Close Reading: Chuck Close and the Art of the Self-Portrait” (2005).A past president of the Association of Art Museum Directors, Mr. Friedman was presented with the National Medal of Arts by President George H. W. Bush in 1989.That occasion was not the first time that Mr. Friedman and the executive branch had crossed paths. In the late 1970s, at the request of his old friend Joan Mondale, whose husband, Walter F. Mondale, was then the vice president, he created an installation comprising dozens of artworks in the vice-presidential mansion in Washington.Not least among them was “Good Humor,” a three-foot-high fiberglass sculpture by Mr. Oldenburg that looks at first glance like a mass of coiled entrails but is actually an immense ice cream bar on a stick, with a pendulous drip at one end.“It won mixed reviews today from reporters and critics who toured the vice-presidential mansion,” The Times wrote of the sculpture in 1977. “Some praised Mrs. Mondale’s judgment in not placing it in the dining room.”
