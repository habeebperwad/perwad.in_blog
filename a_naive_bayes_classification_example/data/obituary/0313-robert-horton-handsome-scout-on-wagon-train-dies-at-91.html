Robert Horton, a ruggedly handsome actor who found television stardom in 1957 as the scout Flint McCullough on “Wagon Train” but who resisted being typecast in westerns as he pursued a parallel career as a singer, died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 91.His death was confirmed by his niece, Joan Evans, who said that he was injured in a fall last November and had recently been placed in hospice care.Mr. Horton recorded albums and sang at the London Palladium, but he was never entirely successful in shedding the frontiersman image. In his later years, he appeared at film-western events around the country.He played Flint from the first episode of “Wagon Train,” in 1957, until the show moved from NBC to ABC in 1962. The series, inspired by the 1950 John Ford film “Wagon Master,” detailed the travails of people aboard a wagon train journeying from Missouri to California after the Civil War. Mr. Horton was the show’s heartthrob, often given occasions to remove his shirt.Starring with Mr. Horton was Ward Bond, who played the grizzled wagon master, Maj. Seth Adams. (Mr. Bond also appeared in the Ford film.)Onscreen the two had an almost father-son relationship, though they did not always appear together; episodes tended to feature one or the other in alternate weeks. But offscreen they often clashed. After one particularly fierce argument, the two men vowed not to appear together on camera again. (They did weeks later, however, when the script called for it.)Mr. Bond died of a heart attack in 1960, and John McIntire became the new wagon master. “Wagon Train” overtook “Gunsmoke” atop the Nielsen ratings in 1961.Mr. Horton left the show when it was at the height of its popularity, turning down a lucrative contract because, he said, he wanted to avoid becoming typecast.“There is a lot more to this business than just collecting your paycheck,” he told The Saturday Evening Post shortly afterward. “Getting rich as an actor and then sitting on an island someplace and drinking vodka is not my idea of how to spend my life. I’m interested in using whatever talent I have.”Mr. Horton pursued a recording and musical theater career while he worked on “Wagon Train,” making albums and performing in nightclubs. His appearance at the Palladium in London drew “squeals and shrieks,” one newspaper reviewer said.He also played the rainmaker in “110 in the Shade,” a musical version of N. Richard Nash’s play “The Rainmaker,” on Broadway in 1963. Despite lukewarm reviews, the show ran for nearly a year, after which Mr. Horton performed in regional theater.In 1965 he returned to westerns to star in “A Man Called Shenandoah,” an ABC series about a man with amnesia who roams the West searching for clues to his past. Mr. Horton said he accepted the part because he saw the show’s story as more interesting than that of a typical western. “Basically it’s a character study of a man in search of his identity,” he told The Daily News of New York.He also sang the show’s theme song, and his rendition was included on an album, “The Man Called Shenandoah.” Though the show lasted one season, the recording remained his most popular.Meade Howard Horton Jr. was born to a well-off family in Los Angeles on July 29, 1924. He was such an impetuous child, he said, that he never felt he fit into his proper Mormon household. He overcame operations for a hernia and an enlarged kidney to play football at a military school in North Hollywood.He enlisted in the Coast Guard in 1943 but was medically discharged because of the enlarged kidney.In 1945, a chance encounter with a talent scout led to an uncredited part in Lewis Milestone’s World War II film “A Walk in the Sun.” Mr. Horton’s parents were not pleased.“I rushed in and said, ‘Dad, I’ve got a part in this picture!’” Mr. Horton recalled. “And he said, ‘That’s probably the worst thing that ever happened to you.’”After earning a bachelor’s degree in theater arts at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Horton moved to New York, where he struggled to find work. He returned to California and appeared in the movie “Apache War Smoke” in 1952. Mr. Horton acted in six more pictures for MGM and appeared on television shows like “The Lone Ranger” and “The Public Defender” before winning the part on “Wagon Train.”He married the former Marilynn Bradley in 1960. She is his only immediate survivor.Mr. Horton threw himself into the “Wagon Train” role. He studied the frontier era, drove the actual route the fictional wagon train took, and invented a back story for his character. He did most of his own horseback riding on the show.He also often fought with the writers.“I have to rewrite half the scripts,” Mr. Horton told The Saturday Evening Post. “Otherwise I’d get laughed off the screen.”
