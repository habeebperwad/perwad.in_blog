Albert Kumin, one of the most celebrated pastry chefs in the United States, who created desserts for the Four Seasons and Windows on the World in Manhattan as well as for Jimmy Carter’s White House, died on Friday at his home in Stowe, Vt. He was 94.His death was confirmed by his daughter, Julie Kumin.Mr. Kumin, Swiss by birth, had been working for a decade in top Canadian hotels when Joe Baum invited him to come to New York in 1958 to work at the Four Seasons, his latest project for Restaurant Associates.It turned out to be a brilliant hire. For the restaurant’s signature dessert, Mr. Kumin invented chocolate velvet cake, a variation on the classic bombe — a dome of chocolate cake, glazed in chocolate, containing a mousse made with chopped-up Heath bars, amaretto and rum. Over the years, the restaurant made more than 200,000 of them.For Mr. Baum, the endlessly inventive Mr. Kumin created a Mexican chocolate candy cake for the pan-Latin restaurant La Fonda del Sol in Manhattan and several desserts for Windows on the World, atop the north tower of the World Trade Center, that attained star status, notably a lemon cream tart and a Grand Marnier chocolate cake.Mr. Kumin was invited to take over as pastry chef at the White House in 1979 while teaching at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. “To me it is an honor,” he told The Washington Post. “It’s about as high as you can go in our trade.”He left a year later for reasons never fully explained. He complained about the high price of Washington real estate. In addition, he told The New York Times, “the edelweiss I planted six years ago at my house is just beginning to grow, so I want to enjoy it.”Friends speculated that he simply grew bored. “Over the years you are going, going,” he told The Post on leaving the position. “Certainly I adjust, but it is pretty hard. It’s like you are in a newsroom and everything goes click, click, click, and then you go in an office and it gets quiet.”He did, however, help prepare the dinner in March 1979 to celebrate the signing of the Camp David accords that took place the previous September, with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and more than 1,300 guests in attendance.At the International Pastry Arts Center, which he founded in 1985 in Katonah, N.Y., he educated dozens of pastry chefs who took positions at top restaurants across the United States.“He is one of the only people I know who can labor relentlessly in the kitchen, covering the work of three, while remaining totally calm, good-humored and friendly,” Jacques Pépin told Nation’s Restaurant News in 1993. The two men worked together in the 1960s for Howard Johnson’s, where Mr. Kumin was hired to organize a high-volume pastry operation.Albert Kümin (the umlaut was later dropped) was born on Jan. 13, 1922, in Wil, Switzerland. His father, Albert, was a hospital nurse and technician, and his mother, the former Regina Vogt, was a homemaker who cleaned houses to earn extra money.Mr. Kumin apprenticed to a local baker at 16 and, after completing his military service, worked at hotel restaurants in Davos, Basel, Winterthur and Zurich. Because of wartime shortages, he later recalled, “you had to work with nothing.”Keen to travel, he set sail in 1948 for Canada, where he found a job at the Ritz-Carlton in Montreal. A colleague there, a fellow Swiss named Henry Haller, later became the White House chef and recommended him for the pastry job.Mr. Kumin also worked at the Mount Royal Hotel and the Windsor in Montreal, the Harrison Hot Springs resort in British Columbia and the Château Lake Louise in Banff, where he met and later married Eva Bold, a farmer’s daughter from Saskatchewan. She died in 2012. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Hedy Süter-Kumin, and two grandchildren.When Mr. Baum, of Restaurant Associates, came calling, at the behest of Albert Stöckli, the company’s Swiss-born executive chef, Mr. Kumin packed his “bible,” a thick notebook filled with recipes for every dessert he had ever made, beginning with his apprenticeship, and what he called Excalibur, the sword he used to cut hardened sugar. Thus armed, he proceeded to tantalize the palates of New York diners with desserts like his cherry-accented Rigi kirschtorte at the Four Seasons and mocha dacquoise at Windows on the World.“You must not taste only sugar,” he told The Times in 1979. “You must taste every ingredient that went into it: the butter, cream, eggs — everything.”After leaving Restaurant Associates in the early 1960s, Mr. Kumin went to work for Howard Johnson’s, setting up a pastry department that turned out 10 tons of Danish pastries a day for the hundreds of restaurants in the chain and thousands of apple, cherry, blueberry and pumpkin pies.He joined the faculty of the Culinary Institute of America in 1972 and returned there after his detour to the White House. A few years later he teamed up again with Mr. Baum to consult on the desserts for Windows on the World and set up a bakery operation to service the many other restaurant operations in the World Trade Center.Asked to create a successor to the chocolate velvet cake, Mr. Kumin created something he called a chocolate pastry cake: layers of cocoa sponge moistened with orange-liqueur syrup, crisp chocolate pastry and whipped ganache, sprinkled all over with chocolate pastry crumbs.“The synergy of crisp layer, moist cake and creamy filling created a subtle interplay of flavor, texture, and richness that forever changed how I think of chocolate cake,” Nick Malgieri, a pastry teacher at the Institute of Culinary Education and a colleague of Mr. Kumin’s at the time, told The Montreal Gazette in July.Country Epicure, a wholesale pastry company in Elmsford, N.Y., owned by the Vie de France Bakery Corporation, hired Mr. Kumin as its executive chef and adviser on product development in 1984, and a year later he founded the International Pastry Arts Center to train budding pastry chefs through seminars and workshops. The school closed in 1992. In 1988, he founded Green Mountain Chocolates in Waterbury, Vt., to make Swiss and Belgian chocolate truffles.Astonishingly, he never wrote a cookbook, nor did he articulate a philosophy. He did, however, have a standard. As he told The Post in 1979, “I am very fussy about the difference between good, very good and delicious.”
