Abbas Kiarostami, often hailed as Iran’s greatest filmmaker, whose searching, parable-like dramas of ordinary people and their problems reflected a poetic vision and a philosophical turn of mind, died on Monday in Paris. He was 76.Iran’s official news agency, which confirmed the death, said he had traveled there to receive treatment for cancer after undergoing surgery in Tehran.Mr. Kiarostami, loosely associated with the Iranian New Wave of the late 1960s, started out making short films about childhood problems for the Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults, where he had established a filmmaking division. He often worked in a semidocumentary style, and used nonprofessional actors, from whom he coaxed extraordinary performances.“At the beginning it was just a job, but it was the making of me as an artist,” he told The Guardian in 2005. “The important thing is that I didn’t work in commercial films. I look at these 20 years as the best period of my professional life.”He remained in Iran after the 1979 revolution and, never a political filmmaker, largely managed to work around the artistic obstacles thrown up by the new regime.He began attracting notice outside Iran with the feature film “Where Is the Friend’s House?” (1987), about a conscientious schoolboy determined to return a friend’s notebook to keep him from being expelled. Told from its young hero’s point of view, it placed the boy’s small story in the social context of rural Iran, with sweeping shots of the landscape.This was the first installment in the three films called the Koker trilogy, set in the village of that name in northern Iran, rocked by a devastating earthquake that struck in 1990.Drawn back to the area, Mr. Kiarostami made two films dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy, “And Life Goes On” (1992) and “Through the Olive Trees” (1994), that marked him as a major talent in world cinema whose profoundly rooted realism and compassion drew comparisons to Vittorio De Sica and the Indian director Satyajit Ray.In his 1997 film, “Taste of Cherry,” he told the story of a well-to-do man, identified only as Mr. Badii, who, determined to commit suicide, accosts a variety of characters as he looks for a volunteer to bury him. Its acute presentation of moral issues and personal crisis, reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman, deeply impressed critics.The film won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.“These are real issues that all of us in our own way face in our own lives, and so rarely are they treated on film: the sense of crying out to others, of needing others, of trying to create a bridge to others,” Richard Peña, the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center at the time, said in 1997, when the film was shown at the New York Film Festival.Abbas Kiarostami was born on June 22, 1940, in Tehran, where his father was a painter and decorator. After winning a painting contest at 18, Mr. Kiarostami enrolled in the School of Fine Arts at Tehran University, working as a traffic policeman to support himself. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1968.The next year he married Parvin Amir-Gholi. The marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by their two sons, Ahmad and Bahman.At the Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults, Mr. Kiarostami made his first film in 1970. In neorealist style, “The Bread and Alley,” just 12 minutes long, told the story of a young boy’s confrontation with a vicious dog. In 1977 Mr. Kiarostami made his first feature-length film, “Report,” about a tax collector who takes bribes.While he was filming “First Case, Second Case,” a documentary about a teacher who collectively punishes a class when one pupil refuses to admit wrongdoing, the Iranian revolution broke out. He had to completely rethink the film, which nevertheless managed to offend the new regime and was never released.Unlike many other artists, Mr. Kiarostami chose to remain in Iran.“When you take a tree that is rooted in the ground, and transfer it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit,” he told The Guardian. “And if it does, the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of nature. I think if I had left my country, I would be the same as the tree.”When he began receiving critical praise in the West, he ran into problems with the Iranian authorities, who often made it difficult for his films to be shown. Conversely, after the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, stringent new visa requirements made it impossible for him to attend the premiere of his new film, “Ten,” at the New York Film Festival in 2002.Mr. Kiarostami, always an idiosyncratic filmmaker, became increasingly experimental in his later work. “The Wind Will Carry Us” (1999), winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice International Film Festival, chronicled a sad engineer’s journey to a Kurdish village, relying on multiple characters whose voices are heard but who never appear on camera.“Five” (2003) had neither character, plot nor dialogue, consisting of long landscape scenes filmed with a hand-held camera. In “Ten” Mr. Kiarostami disappeared as a director, mounting a digital video camera on the dashboard of a car and letting it film the driver as she traveled around Tehran, engaging in conversations with 10 different passengers.In 2010 he made his first film outside Iran, “Certified Copy.” Filmed in Tuscany, it offered a cryptic account of an encounter between a French antiques dealer, played by Juliette Binoche, and a British writer, played by the opera singer William Shimell. His final film, “Like Someone in Love” (2012), filmed in Japan, was an elliptical study of identity, its main characters a Japanese student moonlighting as a prostitute and her elderly client.“At a time of war and isolation, when the whole world thought we are a warmongering country, Kiarostami showed another, peaceful face of Iran,” the professor and journalist Mehrdad Hodjati said in an interview. “He is an icon of change in Iran.”
