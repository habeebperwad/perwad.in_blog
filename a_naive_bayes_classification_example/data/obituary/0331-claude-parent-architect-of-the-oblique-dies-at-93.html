Claude Parent, the French architectural visionary who in the 1950s broke with his traditional Beaux-Arts training and then orthodox Modernism to take a radical course, designing buildings on the oblique instead of the vertical and horizontal, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 93.His daughter, Chloé Parent, said he died at a hospital after his heart had stopped while he was being fitted for a pacemaker. He had celebrated his birthday on Friday.His quiet demeanor, impeccable manners, Issey Miyake jackets and white Rolls-Royce all belied the fact that Mr. Parent (roughly pronounced pah-RAHN) was an instinctive subversive — though a highly successful one, not unlike more conspicuous French rebels like the writer Jean Genet and the artist Yves Klein, with whom Mr. Parent frequently collaborated.Mr. Parent subverted convention from the beginning of his practice, when he and a fellow Beaux-Arts student won a magazine-sponsored competition in 1952 to design and build a house. They created a long, low, California-inspired dream house and then fractured it, breaking the horizontal lines abruptly with a massive wall. The house lost its unity, a radical idea then and now.With the encouragement of the Parisian sculptor André Bloc, who was the influential editor of the magazine Architecture d’Aujourd’hui, Mr. Parent collaborated with many artists, importing ideas from painting and sculpture into a field that usually follows the logic of its own closed system. He broke open solids to achieve plasticity, like a sculptor, and he introduced color in bold patterns, like an abstract artist.His collaboration with Mr. Klein taught him to cultivate the void: In drawings they speculated about building wall-free environments of moving air, with beds cushioned by pulsing air jets in open-air rooms enclosed by air curtains under forced-air roofs and comfortable environments powered by “air-conditioners” hidden below ground.Their drawings depicted buildings that effectively vaporized, much like filmy, see-through Minimalist glass structures done by the avant-garde today. In a field often characterized by caution, Mr. Klein represented “a wild part of my life,” Mr. Parent once told an interviewer. “The deliriousness of his utopia seized me.”In 1957, with Mr. Bloc, he designed the Café du Rond Point on the Champs-Elysées, a walk-through painting-sculpture with a ceiling of angled and tilted planes blithely floating above the escargots and steak-frites. They painted the planes in a palette of neutrals accented with a vivid red.Mr. Parent introduced dynamic instability into the most solid of objects: a building. In 1963, for example, under the influence of the abstract de Stijl artists of the Netherlands, he broke off the living room of a flat-roofed two-story villa he designed in Versailles — the Villa Drusch — and glazed its cube-shaped concrete frame, which he then tilted 45 degrees so that the cube teetered on its edge.Mr. Parent’s interest in dynamic instability matured fully in collaboration with the cultural theorist Paul Virilio, with whom he practiced in the firm Architecture Principe from 1963 to 1968. A student of World War II German bunkers, Mr. Virilio deepened Mr. Parent’s interest in instability by introducing him to abandoned bunkers that seemed to surf down the sandy embankments of Europe’s Atlantic Wall.For Mr. Virilio, the bunkers’ interior environment was troubling because of the vertigo its tilted walls and sloping floors provoked. “But vertigo is wonderful!” Mr. Parent said, as he recalled in an interview last year. “I have to see it!”The tilted bunkers, with their pulling-and-pushing effects on the body, inspired their design for a church in Nevers, Ste. Bernadette du Banlay, which was consecrated in 1966. The building is a concrete hexagonal structure with rounded corners that Mr. Parent and Mr. Virilio split in half to allow light in.Inside, in the 400-seat sanctuary on the second floor, the two halves of the floor, front and back, slope up at different degrees. Rather than trooping to the altar for communion on a Sunday morning, congregants would immediately feel the gentle push and pull of gravity. Space in the building was active, not passive. Priests discovered that coffins would slide off gurneys. Nuns were not amused.Mr. Parent and Mr. Virilio formalized their approach after the church’s construction, naming it the Function of the Oblique, and in 1966 issued a manifesto, “Architecture Principe.”“Parent and Virilio were proposing a new idea of space that broke from the traditional rationalist idea of space open for any inscription drawn into it,” Frédéric Migayrou, deputy director of the Centre Pompidou’s architecture department, said in an interview on Sunday. “Their space was defined by the body in movement. In the ’60s and ’70s, fighting for this meant crazy, incredible combat, but they changed the rules, and opened a new field of thought for architecture.”To study the effects of the oblique, Mr. Parent and Mr. Virilio devised a pair of long, bent cabins suspended 10 meters (or about 33 feet) in the air, each half swinging like a pendulum. Their idea was to live in the cabins under the observation of physiologists and psychologists. But the student rebellion of May 1968 forced them to abort the experiment, and the partners eventually split. After the rebellion, Mr. Virilio wanted to politicize the practice; Mr. Parent wanted to practice the oblique without politics.Mr. Parent went on to build an apparent oxymoron: transgressive shopping centers. His GEM Commercial Center at Sens of 1970 looks like a concrete submarine emerging from the sea, with a pedestrian circulation pattern of switchback corridors, all on the oblique, climbing the front facade.At a time when France had begun a modernization program that included the supersonic jet the Concorde, the high-speed TGV train and the Pompidou Center, the utility company Electricité de France hired Mr. Parent to advise on the design of nuclear power plants.The company sought an architect who could assuage public fears about nuclear power’s impact on the environment with designs that integrated plants into the landscape. (Mr. Parent designed two of them, and he was an advising director on many others.) Many of the huge, parabolic-shaped concrete silos that can be seen today in France resemble Brancusi sculptures, reduced to a smooth and dynamic essence.The project was opposed by many on France’s political left and in the country’s emerging ecological movement, but Mr. Parent felt compelled to accept the reality that nuclear power represented the future. His reputation suffered for it.Mr. Parent closed his office in the early 2000s. But he continued to pursue his visions graphically, producing hundreds of drawings in which he applied his theories of the oblique to panoramas of utopian cities and territories, always populated by figures, to show the effect of his ramped architecture on the body and on populations.“Objecting to the vertical city, he imagined inclined sites, oblique cities where inhabitants, like mountain dwellers, essentially live on slopes in a new organization of space based on health and the pleasure of the body in movement,” said the architect Jean Nouvel, a protégé of Mr. Parent’s. (He dedicated his recent design of the Paris Philharmonic to Mr. Parent.)Bernard Tschumi, a former dean of the Columbia architecture school, who has offices in New York and Paris, said of Mr. Parent: “He was not a marginal figure, but a figure who worked in the margins, in an avant-garde outside the mainstream genealogy of the Modern movement. He played an enormous role, and showed that alternative practices are possible.”Claude Parent was born on Feb. 26, 1923, in the Paris suburb Neuilly sur Seine. His father, Hypolite Parent, was an aeronautical designer and engineer, and his mother, Marie-José Binétrui, owned and ran a modern furniture store.Mr. Parent’s first marriage, to Therèse Houdart, ended in divorce in 1958. He married Bernadette Goulet the next year. She survives him, as do his children, François, Florence and Chloé; his sister, Nicole Parent; and four grandchildren.As his career wound down, Mr. Parent’s reputation paradoxically grew. His church in Nevers, a succès de scandal when it was completed, was declared a national historic monument in 1990; so was his commercial center in Sens, in 2011.In 2009, Mr. Migayrou curated a major retrospective of Mr. Parent’s built and drawn work, inaugurating a new museum in Paris, the Cité de l’Architecture et du Patrimoine.Largely through Mr. Migayrou’s initiatives, Mr. Parent and his Oblique Function were introduced to a young generation of architects adopting the computer as a design tool.“With his sloped floors and inclined walls, he was there first — he was a key figure for my generation,” said Greg Lynn, 51, a pioneer of computer-generated architecture and author of the groundbreaking book “Animate Form.” Mr. Lynn and others of his generation have developed the oblique on their screens, building the continuous topographies and fluid form and space that Mr. Parent introduced.“He was a vibrant thinker,” Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles architect, who met Mr. Parent as a 30-year-old working in Paris, said on Sunday. “He wasn’t worried about what was going on around him in normal practices, and he didn’t belong to any group. He was unabashedly himself. And his drawings were extraordinary — beautiful fantasies, full of poetry.”
