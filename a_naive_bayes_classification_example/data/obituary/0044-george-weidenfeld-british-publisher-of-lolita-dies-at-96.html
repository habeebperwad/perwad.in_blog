LONDON — George Weidenfeld, who fled the Nazi annexation of his native Austria to achieve renown in the salons of postwar London as a publisher, networker and friend of the powerful, died here on Wednesday. He was 96.His family announced his death.Mr. Weidenfeld’s memory of being offered sanctuary in prewar Britain by the Plymouth Brethren, an evangelical Christian denomination, remained with him his whole life. Late last year, as thousands of migrants from Syria poured into Europe, he announced that he had established the Weidenfeld Safe Havens Fund to rescue some 2,000 Christians threatened by the militant Islamic State.“I had a debt to repay,” he told The Times of London, recalling the efforts of Quakers and other Christian groups to rescue Jewish children threatened by the rise of Nazism. “We Jews should also be thankful and do something for the endangered Christians.”Knighted in 1969 and elevated to the British peerage in 1976, Mr. Weidenfeld held court for interviewers at his opulent apartment overlooking the River Thames in Chelsea, describing himself on many occasions as a lifelong Zionist and a “tribal” rather than practicing Jew.Such was the cachet of his invitations that Nicholas Henderson, a former British ambassador, was quoted as saying that “not even Kissinger or de Gaulle leaves one of Weidenfeld’s grand dinners before the end.”Into his 90s, Mr. Weidenfeld remained an energetic student of events, boasting that he traveled every day to his office as nonexecutive chairman of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, the imprint he founded in the late 1940s with Nigel Nicolson, the son of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, who were associated with the prewar literary cabal known as the Bloomsbury Group. The company, sold to the Orion Publishing Group in 1991, later became part of the Hachette empire.In his later years, Mr. Weidenfeld focused on global issues, largely through a policy analysis body, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which he founded in 2006. His life spanned decades of despotisms, but he came to believe that the world faced a greater threat in the 21st century than ever before. Jihadism, he told an interviewer in 2014, was “more dangerous than Nazism or Fascism or Communism.”As a publisher, he acquired works as notable and as disparate as Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita” and “Memory and Identity,” a collection of reflections by Pope John Paul II. He considered “Lolita” his greatest coup — “without a doubt,” as he told the German newspaper Die Welt, for which he wrote a column, in 2014.“Lolita,” the story of the relationship between an older man and a 12-year-old girl, was one of the most contentious books of the postwar, dividing opinion about whether it was pornography or literature.It had already been published in Paris by the Olympia Press in 1955 and by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in the United States in 1958, but in Britain there were concerns that it would be banned. To head that off, by Mr. Weidenfeld’s account, his publishing house devised an elaborate campaign to convince the authorities of the novel’s artistic merit, first providing them with seven advance copies and then securing the de facto endorsement of Nabokov’s work by the intellectual elite at a glittery literary event at Cambridge University.At that gathering, Nabokov himself listed famed Russian authors, asking who did not know the name of such giants as Tolstoy and Chekhov. “But who still remembers the name of a single police chief or censor from St. Petersburg?” Mr. Weidenfeld, in the Die Welt interview, quoted the author as saying. “The next day,” he added, “the government permitted publication.”While he came to be regarded as the doyen of British publishers, known especially for a nonfiction backlist that included the writings of the young Henry A. Kissinger, Charles de Gaulle and Lyndon B. Johnson, his fortunes in the United States were mixed. A partnership started in 1985 with Ann Getty — the wife of Gordon Getty, son of the oil tycoon J. Paul Getty — ate up millions of dollars in advances and extravagant spending before their company, Weidenfeld & Nicolson New York, merged with Grove Press to form Grove Weidenfeld in 1989.Arthur George Weidenfeld was born in Vienna on Sept. 13, 1919, the only son of Max and Rosa Weidenfeld, who raised him in a cultured and cosmopolitan household, teaching him to appreciate the poetry of Ovid and the music of Wagner. He studied law at the University of Vienna and attended the city’s diplomatic college. He also began earning a reputation as a womanizer and a duelist, in one instance fighting a Nazi sympathizer for the honor of his Jewish fraternity, according to the British author and journalist Nigel Farndale.By many accounts, Hitler’s annexation of Austria in 1938 forced Mr. Weidenfeld to flee, virtually penniless, to London, where he secured a job at the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was there he began building a network of influential contacts that would underpin his rise to prominence and lead to his publishing venture with Mr. Nicolson after World War II.Mr. Weidenfield brought to the enterprise a business acumen and “a certain continental intellectualism, which might have been considered pretentious in a native Brit,” the columnist Quentin Letts wrote in 1999 in a profile of him in The New Statesman. At the same time, he added, Mr. Nicolson, a decorated military officer, offered “entree to the old establishment.”On a brief sabbatical in 1949, Mr. Weidenfeld worked in the office of Israel’s founding president, Chaim Weizman, before returning to the world of British publishing and society.In 1952, Mr. Weidenfeld married Jane Sieff, a niece of a founder of the retailing giant Marks & Spencer, and they had a daughter, Laura. The marriage — the first of four — lasted two years. In 1956, he married Barbara Skelton, the former wife of his friend Cyril Connolly, a literary critic and writer, to whom she returned when the relationship soured.His third marriage, to Sandra Payson Meyer, a wealthy and socially prominent American patron of the arts, also ended in divorce. Finally, in 1992, he married Annabelle Whitestone, a concert organizer and former consort of the pianist Arthur Rubinstein, who was 25 years Mr. Weidenfeld’s junior.In addition to his wife and daughter, survivors include grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Mr. Weidenfeld was widely seen as a man of paradoxes.“Everyone has a set of contradictory expectations about George, Grand Old Man of publishing,” the journalist Elizabeth Grice wrote in The Daily Telegraph in 2005. “He’s the teetotal party-giver, the much-married womanizer, the international networker, the Jew fascinated by Catholicism, the Viennese émigré who knows the British establishment better than they know themselves, the wheeler-dealer, the aesthete, the profligate commissioner of books who, it’s said, doesn’t read them.”That tangle of personas was reflected in an interview in 2014, in which Mr. Weidenfeld sketched his loyalties. “My first one is to my family and the Jewish tribe,” he said, followed by allegiance to Britain and then to “the great European civilization: literature, philosophy and music, transmitted to me in the German language and context.”“I have a strong emotional attachment to what I call the ‘real Germany,’ ” he said.Much of the talk about him revolved around the question of his motives: “Social climbing? Or intellectual mountaineering?” as Mr. Letts, the columnist, put it.“In each of us there is an element of snobbery,” Mr. Weidenfeld told The Daily Telegraph in 2005. “I am not snobbish in relation to the royal family; not snobbish of knowing Madonna or disc jockeys — but I am snobbish about meeting historians or the political establishment in different countries.”
