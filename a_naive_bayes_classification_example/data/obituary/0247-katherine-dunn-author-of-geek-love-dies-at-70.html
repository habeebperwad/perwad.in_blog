Katherine Dunn began writing the comic novel “Geek Love” in the late 1970s after her young son refused to join her on a stroll through the famous hybrid rose garden in Portland, Ore. Inspired by the diverse blooms there, Ms. Dunn wondered, What if she could have bred a more obedient boy?She wound up dismissing the thought, however, deciding that flaws were more fascinating than perfection.“I thought that was actually kind of boring, that search for perfection,” she told Caitlin Roper of Wired magazine in 2014. “It would be more interesting to go in another direction entirely, to search for something other than the perceived symmetrical, common notion of perfection. Which got me thinking about freaks and mutations that were not considered desirable. That’s basically how it began.”“Geek Love,” published nearly a decade later, went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies and become a National Book Award finalist in 1989. It was her third novel, after “Attic” in 1970 and “Truck” in 1971, and the last she would publish. She died on Wednesday in Portland at 70, leaving another novel unfinished.“Geek Love” was curiously original and imaginative, though some called it bizarre. It revolves around a married couple who own a traveling carnival and breed mutant children as sideshow freaks, both to attract paying customers and to endow their offspring with “the inherent ability to earn a living just by being themselves.”The offspring include a boy who has flippers instead of arms and legs and a pair of piano-playing conjoined twins. An albino hunchback dwarf narrates the story. Brutality, murderous sibling rivalry and sibling protectiveness are among the story’s themes.The novel, which was Sonny Mehta’s first acquisition as president and editor at Knopf, was an immediate sensation, finding fans everywhere. Harlan Ellison, the science fiction author and screenwriter, hailed it as “transformative.” The musician known as Flea, of the band the Red Hot Chili Peppers, pronounced it “life-changing.”Some critics had reservations. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the poet and novelist Stephen Dobyns, calling it “a comic novel about love, betrayal and power,” said “Geek Love” overindulged in sheer spectacle for its own sake.“Without the spectacle, the novel is undistinguished,” Mr. Dobyns wrote, “but that spectacle becomes part of the novel’s reason for being.”Ms. Dunn also wrote prolifically as a journalist about boxing and other subjects for various publications, including her hometown Willamette Week in Oregon, The Oregonian newspaper in Portland and The New York Times. She also reviewed books, recorded voice-overs for local commercials and hosted a radio program.In 1993, professors at the University at Buffalo included “Geek Love” — along with Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451,” Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man,” Joseph Heller’s “Catch-22,” Kurt Vonnegut Jr.’s “Cat’s Cradle” and Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” — on a reading list to entice students to literature.Katherine Karen Dunn was born on Oct. 24, 1945, in Garden City, a farm town in western Kansas. Her father, Jack, left home when she was a toddler; her mother, the former Velma Golly, an artist from North Dakota, married a mechanic. The family moved frequently, working as tenant farmers, before settling in Tigard, Ore., when she was 12. Her stepfather ran gas stations.She entered Reed College in Portland as a philosophy major.“I enjoyed it until I ran aground in an aesthetics class,” Ms. Dunn told Wired magazine. “I went in thinking, yeah, art, beauty — my meat, drink and air. But on the first day, I didn’t understand a word that was said in class, so I marched out and changed my major to psychology.”During a winter break, she found a boyfriend in San Francisco. She traveled with him and took odd jobs (including wrapping Sugar Daddy candy bars on a factory assembly line in Massachusetts); discovered she was pregnant and gave birth in Ireland; returned to Portland when their son was 7; left her boyfriend; and, as a single mother, made a living as a waitress in a diner in the morning, and a bartender at night.In 2013 she married a former Reed College classmate, Paul Pomerantz, who survives her and confirmed her death, saying the cause was complications of lung cancer. She is also survived by her son, Eli Dapolonia, and a brother, Eugene Hall.Ms. Dunn’s affinity for boxing started when she watched matches on television with her stepfather and brothers.Her book “School of Hard Knocks: The Struggle for Survival in America’s Toughest Boxing Gyms” won the 2004 Dorothea Lange-Paul Taylor Award, given by the Duke University Center for Documentary Studies. An essay collection, “One Ring Circus: Dispatches From the World of Boxing,” was published in 2009.Ms. Dunn’s next novel, “Cut Man,” a fictionalized account of boxing, was scheduled to be published in 2008 but was never finished. In 2010, an excerpt appeared in The Paris Review, where Ms. Roper was managing editor. It carried echoes of “Geek Love.”“It operates in marginal subcultures, and it stars determined though hapless dreamers,” Ms. Dunn said of the work-in-progress in an interview with The New York Times. “It pits the art of violence against the violence of art.”Did the excerpt portend the publication of the novel itself soon?“Soon?” Ms. Dunn said. “Sure, that would be good.”
