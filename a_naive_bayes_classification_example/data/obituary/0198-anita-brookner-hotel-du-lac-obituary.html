LONDON — Anita Brookner, a British author of lean, elegiac and stylistically polished novels who was once labeled the “mistress of gloom” for her depiction of bleak and disappointed lives, usually of women, died on Thursday. She was 87.Her death was reported Tuesday in The Times of London, which said she had led “a life of solitude in the middle of London.” It gave no other details.The daughter of well-off Jewish immigrants from Poland, Ms. Brookner grew up in London surrounded by relatives and acquaintances whom she called “transplanted and fragile people, an unhappy brood.”That sense of an unfulfilled world carried over into her career as a novelist, which she started in her 50s, when she had already distinguished herself as an accomplished art historian. Her fiction soon found acclaim, leading to a Booker Prize, Britain’s most prestigious literary award, for her fourth novel, “Hotel du Lac,” published in 1984.That triumph was seen by some literary figures as a surprise; J. G. Ballard’s “Empire of the Sun” had been widely expected to win the prize. But Ms. Brookner fulfilled her promise, writing a book a year for much of the rest of the 20th century.“It is the women who dominate her landscape,” the English critic Miranda Seymour wrote in The Atlantic magazine in 2001, “and they tend to be women of a type: forlorn figures who seem always to be looking for Henry James’s bench of desolation on which to deposit their meekly skirted behinds for an afternoon of fruitless anticipation.”Ms. Brookner’s first novel, “A Start in Life,” published in 1981 when she was 53, was the story of Ruth Weiss, a young academic who seeks contentment in Paris before returning to London — a mirror of a chapter in Ms. Brookner’s own early life.The novel, published in the United States as “The Debut,” took its title from the Balzac novel “Un Début Dans la Vie,” from the mid-19th century. It introduced readers to the acerbic wit that suffused Ms. Brookner’s later work.“To suggest that Brookner is a comic writer might seem perverse,” Ms. Seymour wrote. “She is, after all, celebrated as the mistress of gloom.”But Ms. Seymour also pointed to Ms. Brookner’s pithy asides — “a fast, lethal swipe with claws extended” — like a line in “Hotel du Lac” in which the main character, Edith Hope, describing a friend, says, “She was a handsome woman of 45 and would remain so for many years.”Ms. Brookner, the author Laura Thompson wrote in The Daily Telegraph in 2014, “is more honest about her own sex than any other novelist.”Ms. Thompson added, “She would probably be torn to shreds by the new feminists were it not for the fact that her calm style helps to conceal her transgressions against orthodoxy.”By the time she started writing fiction, Ms. Brookner had been a prominent art historian specializing in French artists, notably Jean-Baptiste Greuze. At the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, her professors included Anthony Blunt, a renowned art historian later unmasked as a Soviet spy. In the 1960s she became the first woman to hold the Slade chair of fine art at Cambridge University.Ms. Brookner published works on Jean-Antoine Watteau, Greuze and Jacques-Louis David, but among a wider audience it was her fiction that drew attention.“Curiously enough,” her obituary in The Guardian said, “though Brookner’s art histories bubble with the delight of discovery and joyful exposition, her novels tend to describe a gray milieu of enervated, stranded and tentatively hopeless women.”Ms. Thompson also concluded that Ms. Brookner was “an essentially autobiographical writer.”Ms. Brookner, alluding to her first novel, told The Paris Review in 1987 that she had begun to write “in a moment of sadness and desperation.”“My life seemed to be drifting in predictable channels, and I wanted to know how I deserved such a fate,” she said. “I thought if I could write about it I would be able to impose some structure on my experience. It gave me a feeling of being at least in control. It was an exercise in self-analysis, and I tried to make it as objective as possible — no self-pity and no self-justification. But what is interesting about self-analysis is that it leads nowhere — it is an art form in itself.”In “Hotel du Lac,” Edith Hope who is spending time at a Swiss hotel, is wooed by a dashing suitor after an earlier romantic debacle. Discussing the book with The Paris Review, Ms. Brookner offered a rare insight into the interplay between creator and creation.Twice in the book, she said, the fictional author nearly marries. “She balks at the last minute and decides to stay in a hopeless relationship with a married man.”“As I wrote it,” she added, “I felt very sorry for her and at the same time very angry: She should have married one of them — they were interchangeable anyway — and at least gained some worldly success, some social respectability. I have a good mind to let her do it in some other novel and see how she will cope!”Ms. Brookner, who never married, was often quoted as saying that she wrote “because I have no children.”Anita Brookner was born in southeast London on July 16, 1928, the only daughter of a Polish immigrant couple who had changed their name from Bruckner. Her mother was a singer, her father a businessman, and the family was tended to by housemaids and gardeners.“I was brought up to look after my parents,” she told The Paris Review. “My family were Polish Jews, and we lived with my grandmother, with uncles and aunts and cousins all around, and I thought everybody lived like that. They were transplanted and fragile people, an unhappy brood, and I felt that I had to protect them. Indeed that is what they expected. As a result I became an adult too soon and paradoxically never grew up.”She added: “My father, who didn’t really understand the English, loved Dickens; he thought Dickens gave a true picture of England, where right always triumphed. I still read a Dickens novel every year and I am still looking for a Nicholas Nickleby!”While she was born and raised in England, Ms. Brookner never felt comfortable here. “People say that I am always serious and depressing, but it seems to me that the English are never serious — they are flippant, complacent, ineffable, but never serious, which is sometimes maddening,” she said.Ms. Brookner was educated at a fee-paying school for girls in London and at King’s College London, studying French, history and art history. It was Mr. Blunt who “persuaded Brookner to move on to an M.A. in art history,” offering “genial and sympathetic tuition” that led to her doctorate on Greuze, The Guardian reported.She taught at Reading University before becoming a lecturer at the Courtauld Institute. She retired as an academic in 1988 and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990.Her final work of fiction, “At the Hairdressers,” was a novella published as an e-book in 2011. It tells the story of an 80-year-old woman who leaves her basement apartment in London only to go shopping and have her hair done.Though her fiction dwelt mostly on the lives of women, Ms. Brookner did not cast herself as a feminist in the most recent sense.“A complete woman is probably not a very admirable creature,” she told The Paris Review. “She is manipulative, uses other people to get her own way, and works within whatever system she is in. The ideal woman, on the other hand, is quite different: She lives according to a set of principles and is somehow very rare and always has been.”She added: “As for the radical feminism of today, the rejection of the male, I find it absurd. It leads to sterility. They say it is a reasoned alternative, but an alternative to what? To continuity?”While some critics called her work narrow and repetitive, “Brookner is the sort of artist described as minor by people who read her books only once,” the writer Hilary Mantel said in a review of “Strangers,” one of Ms. Brookner’s last novels, in 2009.“The singular quality of each, as well as the integrity of the project, is established. Each book is a prayer bead on a string, and each prayer is a secular, circumspect prayer, a prayer and a protest and a charm against encroaching night.”
