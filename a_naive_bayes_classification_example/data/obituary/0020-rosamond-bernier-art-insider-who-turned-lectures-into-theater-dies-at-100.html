Rosamond Bernier, who transformed the museum art lecture into a dazzling entertainment by blending scholarship, a flair for the dramatic and tales of her days as a free-spirited journalist and friend to Picasso, Matisse and other 20th-century artists, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.Her death was confirmed by her stepson, Olivier Bernier.To anyone who imagines an art lecture to be a droning hour of hard-to-remember dates and abstract expressions of Expressionist abstractions, an evening with Ms. Bernier was a gateway to another realm. Yes, she gave a slide show, and yes, she satisfied academic tastes with plenty of facts and figures.But on what was billed as an occasion of elegance and insight, crowds that had bought tickets months in advance filled auditoriums at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Los Angeles County Museum and other sites in the 1970s and ’80s for Bernier talks of erudition and sophisticated wit — often laced with stories about the legendary artists she had known.Born into privilege on Philadelphia’s Main Line, educated mostly by French governesses, she grew up in a musical home where the guests included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy. As a young visitor in Mexico, she befriended Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Aaron Copland, who later introduced her to Leonard Bernstein.She became a Vogue correspondent in postwar Paris and worked for art magazines before starting her own, the celebrated L’Oeil (The Eye). For a dozen years as the editor and principal contributor, she drew on her friendships with Picasso, Matisse, Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Georges Braque and Fernand Léger for material to fill its glossy pages.After the abrupt end of a marriage, she returned to the United States in the late 1960s and found a second career, almost by accident. Impressed with her knowledge of Surrealism, a friend at Trinity College in Hartford enticed her into lecturing, first at Trinity, then at Rice University in Houston. Somewhat to her own surprise, she was a natural actress — and a hit.In 1971, the Met booked her for four art lectures. Audiences were enthralled. She became one of the hottest tickets in town.Her appearances and fees doubled. Newspapers and magazines took notice, and bookings spread across the country. For nearly four decades, she was in demand, and delivered more than a thousand talks at museums, universities and corporate settings in the United States and Europe.It was no accident. Instead of standing stiffly behind a lectern, Ms. Bernier put on dramatic evening performances like scenes from a one-woman show on Broadway. After a brief musical introduction, she strode onstage under a pinpoint spotlight in a couturier’s evening gown, slender and radiant, beaming to thunderous applause, her long neck sparkling with jewels, her auburn hair framing a strong face.“If people are going to have to look at me for an hour, they might as well have something to look at,” she said. “It’s theater, remember.”Her voice was a modulated flute of cultured accents, and her talk was brisk and conversational, given without notes as she moved fluidly over the stage, for all the world like Rosalind Russell, followed by the spotlight as she gestured for emphasis, held up an objet d’art or called for the next set of slides, shown in pairs to facilitate comparisons.Her talks, a product of serious original research and deft scripts, were no mere textbook recitations. Her subjects ranged from the art collections of Catherine the Great of Russia, Christina of Sweden and Charles I of England to the sweep of art history and the lives of artists, spiced with stories of those she had known.These were candid insider’s accounts of romantic liaisons, sexual peccadilloes and oddball habits of the great pooh-bahs of the art world, and glimpses of her own strange encounters with them — Matisse hissing and cursing furiously as he drew a nude while Ms. Bernier watched; Picasso looking lost in a tattered brown dressing gown, engulfed by junk piled everywhere in his barnlike Paris studio.“He could never bear to part with anything,” she recalled. “Every book, every magazine, every catalog, every piece of wrapping, and every last length of string lay where it had fallen, together with flea-market finds, a stuffed owl, bulging portfolios of drawings and engravings. If anyone ever left anything behind, there was no hope of getting it back. It stayed on to enrich the loam.”Rosamond Margaret Rosenbaum, called Peggy, was born in Germantown, Pa., on Oct. 1, 1916, one of three children of Samuel R. and Rosamond Rawlins Rosenbaum. Her father was a lawyer and director of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, and her home was awash in music. She learned to play the harp and ride horses. A brother died when she was 6; her mother, who was English, died when Ms. Bernier was 8.She spent a few years at an English boarding school and attended Sarah Lawrence College, but dropped out at 19 to marry Lewis A. Riley Jr., a wealthy land developer she met on a trip to Mexico. They settled in Acapulco, where she learned Spanish, flew her own plane, raised a menagerie of animals and entertained notables, including the novelist Malcolm Lowry. She and Mr. Riley divorced in 1943.In 1946, she became Vogue’s Paris-based European features editor. Two years later she married Georges Bernier, a journalist. In 1955, with little capital and no staff, they founded L’Oeil, a bilingual monthly magazine whose beauty of production and superior writing and photography made it required reading in the art circles of Paris, London and New York. A subsidiary produced 16 art books under the Bernier imprint.After her second marriage ended, she moved to New York and in time became a television personality as well as an art lecturer. In the late 1970s and early ’80s, she interviewed artists and narrated documentaries on CBS and PBS. She won a Peabody Award in the late 1970s for two programs on the Pompidou Center in Paris.In 1975 she married John Russell, the art critic of The New York Times, whom she had known since 1956 when, as a writer for The Sunday Times of London, he began contributing articles to L’Oeil. They collaborated on many writing and television projects and lived in a New York apartment crammed with books and art. He died in 2008.Besides her stepson, Ms. Bernier is survived by a stepdaughter, Lavinia Grimshaw.Ms. Bernier’s “Matisse, Picasso, Miro — as I Knew Them” appeared in 1991, and her “Some of My Lives: A Scrapbook Memoir” was published in 2011 to coincide with her 95th birthday. Louisa Thomas, in a review for The Times, called it “a random collection of her memories, snapshots of some of the greatest artists, writers and composers of her day.”Although she had known many writers and composers, Ms. Bernier rarely spoke on those subjects. And after Mr. Russell’s death, she gave up lecturing altogether. For her last, on French couture, she wore a gauzy Halston gown suggestive of an exotic bird of green and black plumage.“In a naughty world,” she said at the conclusion, “the Metropolitan Museum has been an oasis of civility and civilization. To have been connected with it, even in a modest way, has been a joy and a privilege.”
