James Houghton, the founder and, until recently, the artistic director of the Signature Theater Company, one of Off Broadway’s essential nonprofit theaters and perhaps the nation’s leading safe house for playwrights, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 57.The cause was stomach cancer, said his brother, Scott.A former actor, Mr. Houghton (pronounced HOW-ton) was in his early 30s when he started Signature in 1991 with the idea of presenting annual season-long programs featuring the work of just one playwright. The initial season was devoted to Romulus Linney, a prolific and daring but largely unsung dramatist whose play “Heathen Valley” Mr. Houghton had appeared in a few years earlier.In an 85-seat space, Mr. Houghton produced six plays by Mr. Linney, who died in 2011, for a total of $35,000.Over the next quarter-century, playwrights as formidable and famous as Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, August Wilson and John Guare, and others as formidable and not so famous as Lee Blessing, Adrienne Kennedy and María Irene Fornés, had the spectrum of their careers — often including new works — showcased in multiple productions.During the 1994-95 season, devoted to Horton Foote, Signature presented the world premiere of Mr. Foote's play “The Young Man From Atlanta,” which later transferred to Broadway and won a Pulitzer Prize.As the theater grew in artistic power, it gained in financial muscle as well. It moved to bigger spaces, most recently to the Pershing Square Signature Center on West 42nd Street, a three-theater, 75,000-square-foot compound designed by Frank Gehry Architects, for which the theater raised $70 million.Signature’s annual budget now hovers around $13 million, which underwrites an expanded mission: The company sponsors three separate programs that support the residency of 10 playwrights, including rising talents like Annie Baker and Katori Hall, midcareer artists like Kenneth Lonergan and Regina Taylor, and at least one éminence grise, Athol Fugard.A year ago, after learning of his cancer, Mr. Houghton announced that he would step down at Signature after the 2015-16 season. Paige Evans, formerly the artistic director of LCT3, the new-play development program at Lincoln Center Theater, succeeded him.A few weeks ago, interviewed as he was moving out of his office, Mr. Houghton told Ben Brantley of The New York Times that it was working with Mr. Linney as an actor that had spurred the idea for a playwrights’ theater.“I just fell in love with this process with Romulus,” he said. “There was just something so spontaneous — anything could happen in the room. New lines would come, a cut would come, just because of something you either inhabited the script with, or because you asked a question.“At the same time, Romulus, at age 60, was folding his own programs and hanging his own lights, and it just felt like it wasn’t right that he was still pushing so hard, pushing a boulder up the mountain. Anyway, that planted seeds.”James Joseph Houghton was born in San Francisco on Sept. 4, 1958, and grew up in the Bay Area. His mother, the former Joan Heaney, worked as a dental assistant and a preschool teacher. His father, Sherrill, was a school administrator.James fell in love with the theater at St. Ignatius College Preparatory, a Jesuit school in San Francisco, and with friends he started a theater company, Overeasy Productions, when he was 18. He earned a B.F.A. at Santa Clara University and an M.F.A. from the Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.In 1986, he won a place in the Acting Company, the touring classical-theater troupe whose co-founder, John Houseman, became a mentor. The company’s other alumni include Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, David Ogden Stiers, Frances Conroy, Jeffrey Wright, Harriet Harris, Hamish Linklater and Keith David.That same year he married Joyce O’Connor, who survives him. In addition to her and his brother, he is survived by his parents; three sisters, Susan Devine, Lynne Houghton and Trish Line; a son, Henry; and a daughter, Lily.From 2000 to 2003, Mr. Houghton was also the artistic director of the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., developing new plays by Kia Corthron, Gina Gionfriddo, David Lindsay-Abaire, Adam Rapp and many others.From 2006 until his death, he was director of the drama division at the Juilliard School, which was founded in 1968, also by John Houseman. Like Professor Kingsfield, the Harvard law scholar famously played by Houseman in the 1973 film “The Paper Chase,” the drama division was long known for its emphasis on discipline and for upholding rigorous standards that kept the pressure on the small number of students who were admitted after auditions. (In 2016, there were 2,000 applicants for 18 spots.)Mr. Houghton altered the Juilliard audition process and is credited with relaxing the atmosphere of the program. During his tenure, Juilliard added a Master of Fine Arts degree program in drama for the first time and created a partnership with Signature to enable students to work in a professional theater setting.“I don’t think there was anyone in the theater community more beloved than Jim,” the playwright Tony Kushner, whose work was featured in Signature’s 2010-11 season, wrote in an email. “He had a great soul and a grand capacity for friendship and love. He was smart and passionate. He built his singular legacy, founded on his devotion to playwrights’ work and to playwrights themselves, with a uniquely sweet, generous spirit; with unflagging optimism; and with grace.”
