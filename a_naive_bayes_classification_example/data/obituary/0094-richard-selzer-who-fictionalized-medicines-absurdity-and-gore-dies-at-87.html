Richard Selzer, a surgeon who turned his operating-room experiences into fictional stories that blended the gore, the beauty and the absurdity of modern medicine, died on Wednesday in North Branford, Conn. He was 87.His wife, Janet, confirmed his death.Dr. Selzer’s lofty, old-fashioned style infused short stories, essays and memoir. His 1991 New York Times Magazine piece, “A Question of Mercy,” about an AIDS patient requesting assisted suicide, inspired a play of the same title by David Rabe, the Tony Award-winning playwright and screenwriter.Dr. Selzer gave up medicine and turned to writing full time when he was 58.“I noticed my dexterity was decreasing,” he told The Yale Daily News in 2011, “and I didn’t want to hurt anyone, and I also had wanted to become a writer. So I said, ‘I’m going to stop.’ ”He said that when he started writing fiction, in his 40s, he wanted to write medically based stories that “could only have been written by a doctor or surgeon, and yet it would tell a story of human interest.” They were often based on his experiences, but with imaginative twists.One of his best-known stories, “Imelda,” tells of a plastic surgeon who, after his 4-year-old patient dies, fixes her cleft lip so she will look prettier at the wake. “That happened,” he said, “sort of.”He once said, “I believe, and I hope it doesn’t sound immodest, that I am the first one of my kind; that there were no other doctors or surgeons who wrote the kind of things that I’ve been doing.”Jerome Groopman, a Harvard professor of medicine and a staff writer for The New Yorker, endorsed that notion, writing in The New York Times that Dr. Selzer “helped usher in the genre of medical writing in which the physician puts his experiences under the microscope for the lay reader’s scrutiny.”Dr. Selzer delighted in the language of medicine as much as the practice of it. His stories were seasoned with multisyllabic medical terms (necrosis, enucleation, cyanosis) as well as words that have different connotations when used by doctors than when used by patients.In his short story “Whither Thou Goest,” a doctor asks the wife of a brain-dead patient if she would consent to harvesting her husband’s organs for transplantation. ‘“Harvest?’ said Hannah, ‘like the gathering of wheat?’ ”If Dr. Selzer could not find the word he wanted in the dictionary, he made it up. In an introduction to an anthology of his writing, Marie Borroff, the Sterling professor of English emerita at Yale, pointed to a few of her favorite Selzerisms, among them “canimosity,” for a dislike of dogs, and “aqualune,” to describe the path of moonlight in water.“I think my writing is antique,” Dr. Selzer said, “of the past, not of modern tongue. The imagery is baroque, full of metaphors and similes. It’s my way, and I couldn’t do it any other way.”With his high-pitched, airy voice, he would give readings at universities, often to medical students, encouraging many of them to try writing fiction. He admitted that even his nonfiction often stretched the truth.“I’m a liar, but it makes a good story,” he said on more than one occasion. For instance, in a talk at Yale in the 1980s, he said, falsely, that medical students in his creative writing course didn’t know the difference between prostrate and prostate. He said later that the line always drew a laugh.His books include “The Doctor Stories,” “Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery,” “Confessions of a Knife,” “Rituals of Surgery” and “Letters to a Young Doctor.”Allen Richard Selzer was born on June 24, 1928, in Troy, N.Y., the second son of Julius Louis Selzer, a general practitioner, and the former Gertrude Schneider, a singer who performed in local musicals and operas.He graduated from Union College in 1948 and Albany Medical College in 1953. After an internship at Yale, he was drafted into the Army and served as lieutenant in Korea from 1955 to 1957. He finished his surgical residency at Yale in 1957 and practiced until 1985, when he left his medical career to write full time.Besides his wife of 61 years, his survivors include a daughter, Gretchen Lehman; two sons, Larry and Jonathan; and seven grandchildren. He lived in North Branford.Dr. Selzer’s first stabs at fiction were horror stories, published in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.“I came by the horror naturally,” Dr. Selzer once said. “Surgery is the one branch of medicine that is the most violent. After all, it’s violent to take up a knife and cut open a person’s body and rummage around with your hands. I think I was attracted to the horrific.”He was an artist in residence at Yaddo, the artists’ colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 10 times and a resident scholar at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Bellagio Study Center on Lake Como in Italy. (He left Bellagio after one week to move into a monastery, which he found more conducive to writing.)Dr. Selzer received fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1985 and the National Endowments for the Arts in 1988.“I just want to be cremated and blow in the wind,” Dr. Selzer said in an interview for this obituary. However, his wife quickly reminded him, he had already promised to donate his body to Yale.
