Joe Ligon, whose raspy, throbbing vocals and preaching style helped make the Mighty Clouds of Joy one of the most successful gospel quartets of all time, died on Sunday. He was 80.Pastor Isaac Lindsey, the group’s manager, announced the death on the Mighty Clouds of Joy website. He did not say where Mr. Ligon died or specify the cause.Mr. Ligon, a full-throttle singer with a powerful voice reminiscent of Wilson Pickett’s, founded the Mighty Clouds of Joy in the 1950s with several classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in Los Angeles. In a break with tradition, the group added bass, drums and keyboards to the standard guitar backup and developed a funky sound that split the difference between gospel and rhythm and blues.Unlike other gospel groups, its members dressed stylishly — they used the same tailor as the Temptations — and worked slick choreography into their act.“We didn’t want to just sit up there like other groups like we were playing at a funeral,” Mr. Ligon (pronounced le-GAHN) told The Washington Post in 2003. “We used to come out in red, purple, all the loud colors you could think of.”At one performance in Philadelphia, he added, “we were so sharp, people clapped for 10 minutes before we even started singing.”The Mighty Clouds of Joy expanded the gospel audience, reaching the top of the R & B charts in 1974 with “Time,” which they performed on “Soul Train,” marking the first appearance by a gospel group on that show.“When we went on ‘Soul Train,’ my dad got so mad,” Mr. Ligon told The Boston Globe in 1997. “It was unheard of. People thought we’d lost our minds.”A year later, the group had a disco hit, “Mighty High.” Over the years it opened for the Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin and Paul Simon.“The Clouds reached the top by being the hardest-driving, best-dressed, house-wreckingest group in the business,” Alan Young wrote in “Woke Me Up This Morning: Black Gospel Singers and the Gospel Life.”Purists balked, but younger listeners responded. Mr. Ligon, for his part, insisted that the group, while exploring new styles, never strayed.“The Clouds have never sung a song about babes, about breakin’ up, makin’ up, makin’ love,” he told The Globe. “We’ve had plenty of chances. But even though we might play in nightclubs, we’re still singing to lift the name of the Lord.”Until recently, Mr. Ligon lived in Douglasville, Ga. Information on survivors was not immediately available.Willie Joe Ligon was born in 1936 in Troy, Ala., where his father sang in a gospel quartet and his grandfather was a preacher. “I grew up with gospel music in my blood and on my mind,” Mr. Ligon told The Los Angeles Times in 1994.At 14 he visited an uncle in Los Angeles and stayed, enrolling in Thomas Jefferson High. He joined with Johnny Martin, Elmo Franklin and Richard Wallace, singers with other groups, to form the Mighty Mighty Clouds of Joy, which began performing around the city. Two other members, Leon Polk and Elmo’s brother Ermant, left the group early on.A local disc jockey and producer, Brother Duke Henderson, recorded the group on his Proverb label. Executives at Peacock Records in Houston, a leading gospel label, signed the group to a contract after hearing their demonstration recording of “Sinner’s Confession” and shortened the name to the Mighty Clouds of Joy.The label released a single by the group, “Steal Away to Jesus,” in 1960 and followed up a year later with an album, “Family Circle,” whose title track was an up-tempo adaptation of “Will the Circle Be Unbroken.”The group won back-to-back Grammy Awards for best traditional soul gospel performance, for the albums “Live and Direct” in 1979 and “Changing Times” in 1980. “Pray for Me” earned a third Grammy, for best traditional soul gospel album, in 1992. The group’s signature songs included “I’ve Been in the Storm Too Long,” “Nearer My God to Thee” and “Walk Around Heaven.”In the 1960s, Sam Cooke, the former lead singer for the Soul Stirrers, tried to persuade Mr. Ligon to follow his example and make a career in pop music, promising to write songs for him and produce his records. Mr. Ligon turned him down.“I get a feeling singing gospel music that is indescribable,” he told The Los Angeles Times. “I’m devoted, and I’m dedicated. What I get from singing music, you couldn’t buy.”
