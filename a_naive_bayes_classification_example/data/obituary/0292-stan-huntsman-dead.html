Stan Huntsman, who coached outstanding college track and field teams for 39 years, led a dominant United States men’s team at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, and fought tirelessly against cuts in financial support for the sport, died on Wednesday in Austin, Tex. He was 84.His wife, Sylvia, said the cause was complications of a stroke he had two years ago.Huntsman coached at Ohio University (1957-70), Tennessee (1971-85) and Texas (1985-95). At Tennessee, his athletes won N.C.A.A. team championships in cross-country (1972) and outdoor track (1974) and 31 Southeastern Conference team titles, and he was named N.C.A.A. national coach of the year six times.His Olympic career began with the 1976 Games in Montreal, where he was an assistant coach on the men’s track and field team. He was an assistant again with the 1980 team, which never competed: The United States boycotted the Games, in Moscow, to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.His greatest Olympic glory came as head coach in 1988, when his United States men’s team won seven gold medals in Seoul — the most in track and field by any nation — including two by Carl Lewis (in the 100-meter sprint and the long jump).Huntsman’s and Lewis’s paths had crossed in 1983, when Huntsman was head coach of the United States men’s team in the first International Association of Athletics Federations World Championships, held in Helsinki, Finland. His team won six gold medals — three by Lewis — and 18 medals altogether, each mark the most for any nation.In all, Huntsman produced 41 N.C.A.A. individual champions and 201 all-Americans. His best athletes included Patrik Boden, a world-record holder in the javelin throw, at Texas; the sprinter Emmett Taylor at Ohio; and, at Tennessee, the steeplechase Olympian Doug Brown, the hurdler Dave Patrick and the sprinter Willie Gault. (Gault was a member of the 1980 Olympic team and was later a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears and the Los Angeles Raiders.)After the Seoul Olympics, despite his team’s clutch of gold medals, Huntsman had reservations about the state of American track and field.“It’s kind of scary,” he told The New York Times, “because the American public is starting to drift toward wanting to see the superstars and not a good basic track and field meet. Every four years, the Olympic Games save us so that a young man will say this is worthwhile and worth sacrificing eight to 10 years.”That remark was in keeping with Huntsman’s abiding concern for the health of the sport. He was a longtime critic of the N.C.A.A., the major national governing body for college sports, saying it was doing too much for football and too little for track and field and other sports that did not generate revenue.In 1991, after the N.C.A.A. had limited major colleges to 12 track and field scholarships for men and trimmed coaching staffs and practice time, he wrote in a letter to The N.C.A.A. News, “It would be far better to eliminate track and field and perhaps other sports in the N.C.A.A. than to try to struggle on.”In 2007, Ohio University, where Huntsman had earned a master’s degree, eliminated four sports, including men’s and women’s track and field. It cited budgetary reasons and compliance with Title IX, the federal law mandating gender equity in higher education, which required equal athletic opportunities for college women.Huntsman was so angry that he mailed back his master’s degree and had university officials remove his plaque from their athletic hall of fame.“At least try to solve the monetary problems another way,” he said.The women’s team was later reinstated. The men’s team was not, although the university does have a cross-country team.Stanley Houser Huntsman was born on March 20, 1932, in Scottdale, Pa. He was raised in Indiana and starred in football and track and field at Wabash College, where his father, Owen, was the track coach.As a fullback, Huntsman was named to the Little All-America football team for small colleges. In a game against Ball State, he rushed for 259 yards and five touchdowns. The Indianapolis Star once said, “He was built like a medicine ball, and he ran all doubled up through the line.”The Chicago Cardinals (the N.F.L. franchise now in Arizona) took him in the 20th round of the 1954 draft, but he turned to graduate study and coaching instead.He earned a bachelor’s degree from Wabash in 1954 and a master’s from Ohio in 1956. He was elected to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2004.In addition to his wife, the former Sylvia Scalzi, Huntsman is survived by a son, Stanley Stephen; a daughter, Constance Huntsman Stogner; and three grandchildren.With colleges and universities cutting back on the sport, Huntsman came to believe that for American track and field to continue to flourish, it could no longer rely on the college system alone to produce high-caliber runners, hurdlers, jumpers, pole-vaulters and the rest. He argued that once they graduated, athletes needed further support through national programs to allow them to continue to compete.“The American college system can’t cut it anymore,” he told Track and Field News magazine. “You can’t win with college boys.”
