Viktor Korchnoi, who was widely considered one of the greatest chess players in history but never captured the world championship in more than 60 years as an elite competitor, died on Monday in Switzerland, where he had lived for decades after defecting from the Soviet Union. He was 85.He had been ill since he suffered a stroke several years ago, his son, Igor, told The Associated Press.Mr. Korchnoi was stubborn and combative. He often would capture his opponents’ pieces even if it exposed his king to danger, and then go into a defensive crouch, grimly trying to hang on to his extra booty. When he lost, he could be condescending toward his opponents, who, he judged, had benefited from his mistakes rather than their own skill. His nickname was “Viktor the Terrible,” largely because of his temper.Garry Kasparov, the world champion who defeated Mr. Korchnoi in a 1983 match, wrote in the preface of Mr. Korchnoi’s autobiography, “Chess is My Life”, “In all of history you cannot find another player with his long-lived discipline, vigour and ferocity.”Mr. Korchnoi won his first major tournaments in the 1940s, when he was a teenager, and his last major events in the 2000s, when he was in his 70s. In January 2007, at 75, he was ranked No. 85 in the world — by far the oldest person to be ranked in the top 100 since the ranking system began in 1970. He continued to compete at a high level until he was 81, when he had a stroke.The height of Mr. Korchnoi’s career came in 1974, in his middle age, when most players are in decline. Having qualified for the final match to determine a challenger for the world championship, he faced Anatoly Karpov, who was 20 years his junior and was to become his bête noire.Mr. Karpov narrowly prevailed, winning three games and losing twice in a 24-game match, with the rest ending in draws. Mr. Karpov then became the de facto world champion a year later after Bobby Fischer, the American who captured the title in 1972, resigned to protest the proposed rules of a match with Mr. Karpov.In 1978, after defeating many rivals, Mr. Korchnoi emerged as Mr. Karpov’s first official challenger for the world championship.There was more at stake than just the world title: Two years earlier, Mr. Korchnoi had defected while playing in a tournament, and was considered a traitor by the Soviet Politburo.His wife, Bella, and their son, Igor, were still in the Soviet Union and had not been allowed to leave. Just months before the match against Mr. Karpov, Igor was conscripted into the Soviet Army, though he refused to serve and became a fugitive. He was eventually caught and imprisoned for more than two years.The players met in Baguio City, the Philippines, in a title match that had elements of farce.Among the Soviet team of trainers and support staff was Vladimir Zukhar, who sat in the audience with his gaze fixed on Mr. Korchnoi. After Mr. Korchnoi lost Game 8, Mr. Korchnoi protested Mr. Zukhar’s presence, insisting that he was a parapsychologist. Mr. Zukhar was moved to the seventh row, but his presence in the playing hall remained an issue. Before the start of 17th game, Mr. Korchnoi threatened to pummel him.To ward off Mr. Zukhar’s effects, Mr. Korchnoi took to wearing dark glasses. Mr. Karpov protested that he could no longer see Mr. Korchnoi’s eyes and was distracted by the reflection.After Mr. Korchnoi lost games 13, 14 and 17 with just one win to Mr. Karpov’s four, he began studying with two yogis. They tried to attend the games, but were met by protests by the Soviets and were eventually barred from the playing hall.Mr. Korchnoi continued to fall behind, but then stormed back, winning games 28, 29 and 31. But Mr. Karpov won the 32nd game — and with it, the match.A rematch in 1981 was not nearly as close — Mr. Karpov won, 6 to 2. A year later, Bella and Igor were allowed to emigrate.Viktor Lvovich Korchnoi was born in St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad, on March 23, 1931. He grew up in poverty. His father taught Russian and literature; his mother taught piano. His parents divorced when Mr. Korchnoi was quite young and he went to live with his father, partly because his mother was too poor to support him. His father taught him to play chess when Viktor was 6.By his own admission, Mr. Korchnoi was a poor student. He tried to study music, but also did badly at that. That left chess, and he roamed the city looking for competition, displaying enough aptitude that he won Leningrad’s junior championship in 1946 and the Soviet Junior Championship a year later.He soon had offers of training, but he usually rejected them — a result of his stubborn independent streak, which he acknowledged in his autobiography had almost certainly held him back. He won the Soviet Championship — then considered to be the most difficult tournament in the world to win — in 1960, 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1970.Despite his success at a game considered essential to the propaganda purposes of the Soviet Union, Mr. Korchnoi often ran afoul of the authorities by speaking his mind. He had joined the Communist Party in an effort to smooth things over, but it did not work.After he lost to Mr. Karpov in 1974, he began to be criticized by the Soviet authorities. “For my public appearances and for my lectures, they began summoning me for criticism,” he wrote in his autobiography. “I keenly sensed that I could no longer be useful to the people. I had to flee!”The chance to defect came in 1976 while he was playing in a tournament in the Netherlands. After giving an interview in which he criticized the Soviet authorities, he shortly received word from friends in the Soviet Union that he was in trouble.After his defection, he sought his family’s release by petitioning governments for help. He began an affair with a woman named Petra Leeuwerik, who had also been imprisoned in the Soviet Union years before. After Mr. Korchnoi’s family was freed, he divorced Bella and married Ms. Leeuwerik. He eventually became a Swiss citizen.He is survived by his son, Igor, and his wife, Petra.“No matter what a hard life I have had or how open I am about my conflicts with the Soviet state and my past opponents,’’ Mr. Korchnoi wrote in his autobiography, “chess is all that matters to me in the end.”
