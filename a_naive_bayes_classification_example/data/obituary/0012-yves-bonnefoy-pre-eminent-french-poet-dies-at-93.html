Yves Bonnefoy, who was generally regarded as France’s pre-eminent poet of the postwar era, as well as its leading translator of Shakespeare and a wide-ranging art critic in the spirit of Baudelaire, died on Friday in Paris. He was 93.In a statement, François Hollande, the president of France, called Mr. Bonnefoy “one of the greatest poets of the 20th century” and praised him for “elevating our language to its supreme degree of precision and beauty.”Mr. Bonnefoy (pronounced bun-FWA) burst onto the literary scene in 1953 with “On the Motion and Immobility of Douve,” a long poetic sequence that revolved around a mysterious female figure, Douve, whose shifting guises invoked the powers of death and rebirth and poetry itself. The work has often been compared, in impact, to the publication of Paul Valéry’s first column of verse, “La Jeune Parque” (“The Young Fate”), a generation earlier, in 1917.“It was a stunning achievement, a work of extraordinary technical mastery, playing with the traditional alexandrine, the 12-syllable line, but subverting it,” John T. Naughton, the author of “The Poetics of Yves Bonnefoy” (1984), said in an interview. “Readers sensed that a new voice had come on the scene, and that a new generation was coming to prominence after the war.”By 1978, when his collected poems were published, Mr. Bonnefoy’s position as France’s most important poet, and one if its most influential men of letters, was secure. After Roland Barthes died in an accident in 1980, Mr. Bonnefoy was elected his successor to the chair of comparative poetics at the Collège de France, making him the first poet to join the institution since Valéry in 1937.The French Academy awarded him its grand prize for poetry in 1981, and in 1987 he was awarded the Goncourt Prize for Poetry.Yves Bonnefoy was born on June 24, 1923, in Tours. His father, Élie, who worked in a locomotive-assembly shop, died when Yves was 13. His mother, the former Hélène Maury, worked as a schoolteacher to support the family.After graduating from the Lycée Descartes, where he took advanced courses in philosophy and mathematics, Yves studied mathematics at the University of Poitiers. In 1943, he headed to Paris, ostensibly to complete his studies in mathematics, but in fact he had determined to establish himself as a writer and, deeply influenced by André Breton and Paul Éluard, to mingle with the Surrealists.He started a surrealist journal, “Revolution, Night,” where he published a long poem, “Heart Space.” Gradually, however, he found himself out of sympathy with the movement and its obsession with magic and the supernatural. When asked to sign the Surrealist manifesto “Inaugural Rupture” in 1947, he declined.He took courses at the Sorbonne, somewhat aimlessly, but managed to obtain travel grants that took him to Italy to study Piero della Francesca; to the Netherlands to study the 17th-century painter and printmaker Hercules Seghers; and to London.He returned to the study of philosophy and completed a thesis on Kierkegaard and Baudelaire at the Sorbonne under the direction of Jean Wahl, a pivotal figure who helped introduce Hegel and Kierkegaard to France.Wahl found a position for Mr. Bonnefoy at the National Center for Scientific Research to write on the New Criticism and the philosophy of literary criticism in the English language. An essay he wrote on English and French criticism eventually found its way to the journal Encounter, which published it in 1958, securing his entree to the academic worlds of Britain and the United States. He later taught literature at several American universities, including Brandeis, the City University of New York, Johns Hopkins, Princeton and Yale.In 1946, the influential bookseller and publisher Adrienne Monnier had displayed Mr. Bonnefoy’s self-published poem “The Pianist’s Disquisition” (next to James Joyce’s “Ulysses”) on the “recommended” table in her bookstore on the Rue de l’Odeon. When she became a poetry editor at the Mercure de France, she invited Mr. Bonnefoy to contribute a volume. He responded with “Douve,” which Galway Kinnell translated into English in 1992.Mr. Bonnefoy came of age in the midst of a world war, and a seeming collapse of all civilized values and beliefs. His poetry was suffused with the search for unity and meaning in a meaningless age. Central to his thinking was the concept of “presence” — a preconscious apprehension, usually stimulated by the natural world, of “time transfigured by the moment,” as he once put it.In this quest, language was the key that both opens and locks the doors of perception. “We are deprived through words of an authentic intimacy with what we are, or with what the Other is,” Mr. Bonnefoy said in an interview with The Paris Review, published in 1994. “We need poetry, not to regain this intimacy, which is impossible, but to remember that we miss it and to prove to ourselves the value of those moments when we are able to encounter other people, or trees, or anything, beyond words, in silence.”Mr. Bonnefoy’s tormented self-searching continued in the “Hamlet”-like collection “Yesterday’s Wilderness Kingdom,” but his 1965 book, “Words in Stone,” reflected a newfound sense of spiritual calm, or at least resignation.For several years, Mr. Bonnefoy had been renovating an old farmhouse in Valsaintes, in Provence, with Lucy Vines, an American expatriate whom he married in 1968. (His first marriage had ended in divorce.) She survives him, as does their daughter, Mathilde Bonnefoy.The countryside surrounding his new home, which he once called “the one true place,” supplied him with an inexhaustible store of images that populate “Words in Stone,” “The Lure of the Threshold” (1975) and “In the Shadow’s Light” (1987). It also inspired a fierce engagement with elemental natural forces — stone, tree, desert, wind, fire, water.A stay in New England, teaching at Williams College, inspired many of the poems in “Beginning and End of the Snow” (1991). His later collections include “The Wandering Life” (1993), “The Curved Planks” (2001) and “The Long Chain of the Anchor” (2008).Many readers found his verse highly abstract and often obscure. He made no apologies. “It is not a question of reveling in a hermetic language exclusive to a few insiders, but of breaking down stereotypes which no longer give an authentic representation of reality, only a superficial one, and therefore do not allow real exchanges,” he told The Paris Review.In 1954, the translator Pierre Leyris, who was overseeing the publication of the complete works of Shakespeare into French, assigned Mr. Bonnefoy a few scenes from “Julius Caesar” as a tryout. Delighted with the results, he asked him to translate the entire play, then added “Hamlet,” “Henry IV, Part I” “The Winter’s Tale,” and the poems. Mr. Bonnefoy plunged deeply into Shakespeare and his works, and never emerged.“When I went to America in 1958 I knew Elizabethan English better than the contemporary idiom — you were lucky if I didn’t use ‘multitudinous’ or ‘incarnadine’ instead of ‘many’ or ‘red,’” he told The Paris Review.Over the years, he translated 15 of the plays, all of the sonnets, and wrote extensively on Shakespeare’s poetics. His translations of Yeats are equally well known in France.His many works of art criticism include studies of Goya, French Gothic murals and Italian Baroque painting.In 1972, Mr. Bonnefoy published a philosophical memoir, “L’Arrière-Pays” (“Heartland”), about his summer visits to his maternal grandparents, who lived in Toirac, a village in the Lot River valley.“It is writing verse that always calls me back again,” he told The Paris Review. “I need to have a long period free, during which I can listen to the voices that come from the deepest unconscious — which know more than we do about life and death.”
