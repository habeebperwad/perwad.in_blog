Elaine Lustig Cohen, whose prolific graphic design career began — almost accidentally — with signage for the celebrated Seagram Building in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.Her death was confirmed by her daughter and only immediate survivor, the graphic artist Tamar Cohen.A photography column in The New York Times in 1997, on the occasion of an exhibition of her photocollages at a SoHo gallery, summed up Ms. Cohen as having “the soul of a Bauhaus devotee” and “the eye of a Constructivist.” Steven Heller, her co-author on “Born Modern,” a biography of her first husband, the design pioneer Alvin Lustig, described her as “the quintessential Modernist,” happy to talk about the past but “always in the present.”Ms. Cohen’s graphic design career really began just after her first husband, 12 years her senior, died of complications of diabetes in 1955, at 40. She liked to describe her job with him in New York as “office slave,” preparing mechanicals and making type specifications. But others may have seen her as his partner.Shortly after Mr. Lustig died, the star architect Philip Johnson called his widow to ask when the first stage of the Seagram’s signage project, assigned to Mr. Lustig, would be ready.“I had never designed anything on my own in my life, but I did every piece,” she told ArtForum 60 years later. “The 375 address outside, the Brasserie sign, fire hose connections, switches, even things that wouldn’t be seen.” The building opened in 1958 and was immediately hailed as a minimalist architectural masterpiece.Her clients in the years ahead included the Jewish Museum, General Motors, the Museum of Primitive Art, the Federal Aviation Administration, Rio de Janeiro’s Museum of Modern Art and the 1964 World’s Fair.She designed museum catalogs and furniture. As a book-cover designer, she followed in Mr. Lustig’s precisionist footsteps but eventually established her own, more free-form style.“I tried to reflect the spirit of the books,” she said in a video made by AIGA, the graphic arts organization, when she was awarded its medal in 2012.Her jacket for “Yvor Winters On Modern Poets” looked as if plastic letters had been placed on a tabletop, then jostled by a passing child. A book about St. Augustine featured his name twice, as the arms of a cross. The jacket for Tennessee Williams’s short-story collection “Hard Candy” showed extreme close-ups of cellophane-wrapped sweets, seeming to fall through the air.She then turned to making art. Writing in The Times about a 57th Street gallery show of hers in 1976, the critic John Russell praised the subtlety of the colors in her paintings. In 1979, she was the first woman to have a solo show at the trendy Mary Boone Gallery downtown.Last year, 10 of her paintings were shown at the underground gallery of Philip Johnson’s Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., leading a reviewer for Art in America to comment on their blend of art and design: “They hold the room but do not resolve it as design would. They upend space and continue to intrigue.”But her earlier work also ended up in museums. A Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum exhibition in 1995 displayed more than 80 of her book covers and institutional graphics.She loved combining type and images and had an affection for 20th-century avant-garde typography. When she was 80, she was creating alphabets in the computer graphics app Adobe Illustrator.Elaine Firstenberg was born on March 6, 1927, in Jersey City, the daughter of Herman Firstenberg, a plumber, and the former Elizabeth Loeb. She was given art lessons but traced her passion for art and design to the day, when she was 15, that she walked into Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century gallery, which had opened on 57th Street that year.Ms. Firstenberg studied art at Sophie Newcomb College, part of Tulane University, in New Orleans. After two years, believing her only art-career option as a woman was teaching, she transferred to the University of Southern California to major in art education. She received a bachelor’s degree in 1948.She signed on as a summer intern at the new Modern Institute of Art in Los Angeles and, at the opening, met Mr. Lustig. They were married the same year.The new bride taught junior high school but quit after one year. It was “an awful experience,” she told the online magazine Bomb in 2013. “I was too young to be teaching 14-years-olds.” It seemed natural to go to work in her husband’s office. (Her mother had done the same, acting as bookkeeper for her husband’s plumbing business.)No one seemed surprised that Mr. Lustig did not plan to teach his young wife graphic design, using her instead as “an all-purpose secretary, production assistant and draftsperson,” as a 1995 article in Eye magazine said. She herself summed up the situation philosophically, as quoted by Mr. Heller: “It was, after all, a different time.”The newlyweds worked briefly in Los Angeles, then moved to New York when Mr. Lustig was invited to create a design program at Yale. They were still in New York when he died, seven years after they were married.Arthur A. Cohen, an author and the founder of Noonday Press and Meridian Books, was a client and close friend of the Lustigs. After Alvin Lustig’s death, Ms. Lustig and Mr. Cohen continued to work together; they were married in 1956 and had a daughter.In 1973 the couple founded Ex Libris, which sold antiquarian books and periodicals on the ground floor of their East 70th Street townhouse. But her new career had taken hold; when Mr. Cohen died in 1986, his obituary identified her as “the painter Elaine Lustig Cohen.”In the end, though, she told a writer for Artforum last year, her design and art sensibility, her sense of abstraction, “came from architecture.”“When I was doing graphic design in the postwar period, architecture was going to save the world,” she recalled. “We were all going to be good in life because of the space we lived it in.”
