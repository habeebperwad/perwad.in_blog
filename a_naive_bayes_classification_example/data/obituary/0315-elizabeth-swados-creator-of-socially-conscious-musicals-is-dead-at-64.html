Elizabeth Swados, a composer, writer and director who fashioned a unique style of socially engaged musical theater, drawing on a global menu of musical styles and a street-level engagement with the politics of the dispossessed, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 64.The cause was complications of surgery for esophageal cancer that she had undergone in April, her wife, Roz Lichter, said.Ms. Swados (pronounced SWAY-dose) was already a talent to watch when, while still a student at Bennington College, she provided the music for Andrei Serban’s adaptation of “Medea” at La MaMa, the downtown Manhattan avant-garde theater.In 1978 she had a breakout hit with “Runaways,” a musical revue about runaway teenagers that originated at the Public Theater’s Cabaret and made the move to Broadway, personally earning four Tony nominations. Ms. Swados wrote and directed the play, whose cast was made up of 18 troubled young people she had interviewed while researching broken families. She also composed the music, contributed the lyrics and played guitar offstage.“With ‘Runaways,’ she steps right into the front line of popular American theatrical composers,” Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote in a review of the musical at the Public Theater. “This is the first musical since ‘Hair’ to unite, successfully, contemporary popular music and the legitimate theater.”Over the next several decades she poured forth a seemingly endless stream of stage productions that tested the vocabulary of critics, who described them variously as song cycles, mosaics, tapestries and oratorios. In the 1980s she collaborated with the cartoonist Garry Trudeau on two social satires for the theater, “Doonesbury” and “Rap Master Ronnie.”“What I set out to do was make an experimental musical theater,” she told The Times in 1991. She added, “Broadway is a museum that’s not moving forward, and musical theater should reflect what and how we are now — our pop culture, our political situation.”Ms. Swados wrote three novels and seven books for children, as well as the memoirs “The Four of Us: The Story of a Family,” about her difficult family history, and “My Depression: A Picture Book,” an account of her mental struggles that she translated into an animated film. The film, “My Depression (The Up and Down and Up of It),” was broadcast on HBO in July.Elizabeth Swados, known as Liz, was born on Feb. 5, 1951, in Buffalo. Her father, Robert, who had once considered acting as a career, was a successful lawyer who helped establish the Buffalo Sabres as a National Hockey League franchise. Her mother, Sylvia, a former actress and poet, slipped into depression and alcoholism and committed suicide just as her daughter was starting her career in the theater. Her brother, Lincoln, developed schizophrenia and died in 1989.“I’m not an unhappy person,” she said in 1978. “I live in wild swings of mood, but I sure live!”At Bennington, she studied music and creative writing. Her first symphonic work served as a kind of marker for her wayward career. It was an overture in which 30 actors posed as a Balinese monkey chorus. She found her influences everywhere, in ragtime and raga, in calypso and rock ’n’ roll. She loved to incorporate bird calls into her music.This eclectic bent was on full display in “Nightclub Cantata,” a revue produced at the Village Gate in 1977, based on texts by Sylvia Plath, Pablo Neruda and other poets. Clive Barnes, in his review for The Times, called it “the most original and perhaps the most pleasurable form of nightclub entertainment I have ever encountered.”She went on to compose the music for “The Incredible Feeling Show,” which she adapted from her children’s book “The Girl With the Incredible Feeling,” and to direct and compose the music for “Dispatches,” adapted from the Michael Herr book about the Vietnam War.Her many musical works included “Lullabye From Baby to Baby,” “Every Now and Then” and “Lullaby and Goodnight,” which, despite its soothing title, dealt with pimps and prostitutes. She wrote a number of works on Jewish themes, including “The Haggadah: A Passover Cantata” and “Jerusalem,” an oratorio adapted from poems by Yehuda Amichai.In 1984, after collaborating with Mr. Trudeau to bring his comic strip to the stage, she was the composer for “Rap Master Ronnie,” a sequence of satirical story-songs about the Reagan administration billed as a “partisan revue.”More recently she collaborated with Erin Courtney on the madcap “Kaspar Hauser: A Foundling’s Opera,” presented at the Flea Theater in Lower Manhattan in 2009, and the oratorio “Resilient Souls” (2010), about the murders carried out by death squads in El Salvador in the 1980s.Besides her wife, Ms. Swados, who lived in Manhattan, leaves no immediate survivors.“There’s a feeling that one should either be extremely ‘cultural’ or one should be entertainment oriented,” she told the reference work Contemporary Authors in 2007. “I feel the two can be combined. I will not sway from that.”She added, “The cultural area has gotten too elite, and the entertainment business has gotten really tacky.”
