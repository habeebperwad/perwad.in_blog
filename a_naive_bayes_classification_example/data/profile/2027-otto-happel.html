			Otto Happel, who studied engineering at RWTH Aachen University, inherited his father's dust-removal business and turned it into thermal engineering firm GEA. In 1999, he sold his 50.1% stake in GEA to Germany's MG Technologies for around $775 million in cash and kept a 10% interest in the combined group (later increased to 21% via share purchases). In 2005 the company renamed itself the GEA Group.  Happel cashed out in 2006, selling his remaining stake to institutional investors for approximately $700 million. In 2015, he attended the World Economic Forum in his role as chairman of the Swiss private wealth management firm Luserve AG. An enthusiastic sailor, he has a yacht named Hetairos and lives in Switzerland with his wife and six children. A foundation in his name supports projects in the developing world.
