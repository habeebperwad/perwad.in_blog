			Lui Che Woo, chairman of Galaxy Entertainment Group, saw his wealth jump nearly 50% in 2016 thanks largely to recovering casino revenues. In October 2016 his Lui Che Woo Prize, which focuses on promoting "mutual respect, mutual understanding and the coexistence of technology, innovation and love," awarded $2.6 million to each of its first three laureates.  "With all the world's technological advances, material riches and prosperity, [that] actually [doesn't] mean that there's peace within people," he said. Liu arrived in Hong Kong at the age of 4 and as a teenager helped support his family by selling food on the street. Today his eldest son, Francis Lui, runs the gambling side of the family's business, while his four siblings hold a variety of roles within his property conglomerate K. Wah Group.
