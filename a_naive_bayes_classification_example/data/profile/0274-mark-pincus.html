			Mark Pincus cofounded Zynga, an online social game maker known for popular apps Words With Friends and FarmVille. Pincus stepped down as chief executive to give way to Microsoft exec. Dan Mattrick in June 2013, then returned as CEO in April 2015. He stepped down as CEO for the second time in March 2016. A serial entrepreneur, Pincus launched a string of successful websites, including Support. com, before creating Zynga in 2007. Pincus was also an early investor in Napster, Twitter and Facebook. He made headlines in April 2012 when he sold off about 16.5 million Zynga shares in a move that was widely criticized. He was able to sell while employees were forced to hold on to their shares during the stock's steep decline in the following months. Pincus' wife, Alison, cofounded One Kings Lane, a flash sales site for home goods, which was sold to Bed Back & Beyond in June for far less than the company's previous $1 billion valuation.
