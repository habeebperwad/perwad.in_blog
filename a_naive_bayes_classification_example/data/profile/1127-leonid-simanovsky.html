He began his career as a fitter in a factory producing space rocket technology.  He met fellow billionaire Leonid Mikhelson, his partner in Novatek, in the late 1980s, when he worked at Mikhelson's construction company. Since 2003 he has been a State Duma deputy and a member of Vladimir Putin's Yedinaya Rossiya (United Russia) party. He is a deputy chairman of the Duma's budget and tax committee.
