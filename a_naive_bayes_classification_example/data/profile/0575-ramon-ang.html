			Consummate car collector Ramon Ang runs conglomerate San Miguel. Originally a brewer, San Miguel is market leader in food and beverages but the bulk of its revenues stems from power, fuel, oil and infrastructure businesses.  Ang's privately held Eagle Cement boasted 30% margins in 2015. He also owns a hotel and 100 acres of prime real estate. Ang got his start fixing up and selling used Japanese car and truck engines before partnering with Eduardo Cojuangco's son to sell aluminum wheels.
