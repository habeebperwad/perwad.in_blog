			Jacques D'Amours co-founded convenience store conglomerate Alimentation Couche-Tard in 1980. He retired as VP of administration in 2014, but remains on the company's board. Over the last decade Couche-Tard has ballooned by snatching up competitors, including the Circle K line of convenience stores in 2003 and Scandinavian fuel and retail giant Statoil in 2012. It bought leading Irish gas and convenience brand, Topaz, in February 2016. The publicly-traded, $34 billion (sales) Couche-Tard has 8,000 stores in North America, plus more than 4,000 company-owned and franchised stores throughout the rest of the world.
