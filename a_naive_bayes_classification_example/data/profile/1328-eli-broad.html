			The son of Lithuanian immigrants, Eli Broad grew up in the Bronx and Detroit. He bought his first real estate at age 20 and cofounded home builder Kaufman & Broad in 1957 with $12,500 borrowed from his in-laws.  It became one of the nation's biggest home builders, supplying parents of baby boomers with affordable housing. He later bought Sun Life Insurance, transforming into annuities giant SunAmerica, before selling it to AIG for $18 billion in stock in 1998. In February 2017, Broad, an advocate of charter schools, sent a letter to Senate leaders opposing the confirmation of billionaire Betsy DeVos as education secretary and calling her "unprepared and unqualified." The Los Angeles art museum that Eli Broad and his wife opened in September 2015 welcomed 823,000 visitors in its first year. Known as The Broad, it offers free general admission to view 2,000 works from the couple's $2 billion (est. value) contemporary art collection. The Broads' foundations, which have $3 billion in assets, support medical research, public education and Los Angeles civic projects.
