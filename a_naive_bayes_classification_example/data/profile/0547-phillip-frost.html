			Phillip Frost's latest company is diagnostics-maker Opko Health, which he founded back in 2007. He is a long-time health care investor, inventor and founder. While practicing in Miami in the 1960s, he tinkered with a disposable device to make biopsies easier.  He recognized the tool had potential both in the examination room and the marketplace, and partnered with Michael Jaharis to build a company around it. Jaharis took care of the boardroom and ran the day to day. Frost stayed in the lab and added new patents. Their duet was a hit and Jaharis became a billionaire, too. They sold Key Pharmaceuticals to Schering-Plough in 1986 for $835 million, and the two parted ways (Jaharis died in February 2016). Frost next invested in a small chemicals firm, bought a diagnostics company and founded a pharmaceuticals business that became generic drugmaker Ivax in 1987; he sold it to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $7.6 billion in 2005.
