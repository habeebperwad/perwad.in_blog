			Stephan Schmidheiny, industrial magnate turned philanthropist and environmentalist, rose to prominence in 1976 when he became board president of his father's construction materials company Swiss Eternit Group at age 29. He sold his holdings in the late 1980s.  In 2001, Schmidheiny began to withdraw from his remaining business functions and from public life, and in 2003 he donated all shares of his forestry firm Grupo Nueva to his irrevocable Viva Trust, the profits of which are used to promote causes related to sustainability and education.
