			Theo Mueller is the sole owner of an increasingly diversified food enterprise grounded in dairy processing and marketing. His grandfather founded the business in 1896, in Aretsried, Bavaria. When Theo took the reins from his father in 1971, the village dairy had just four employees.  Implementing new techniques in milk processing and building up sales and distribution infrastructure, his became the first dairy in Germany to offer nationwide distribution of fresh milk products -- a roll-out supported by advertising campaigns and TV spots featuring sports legends Gerd Mueller (soccer) and Boris Becker (tennis). Today, in addition to dairy subsidiaries, Theo Mueller Group comprises packing, logistics, vehicle maintenance, fruit processing, a fish restaurant chain (Nordsee) and artisanal bakery shops/cafes (Bastian's). Acquisitions have extended the company's presence as well as its product range (e.g., chilled gourmet salad, sauces and dressings). The Luxembourg-based Mueller Group -- which now has 21 production plants in ten countries, employs 27,000 people and generates revenue of around $7 billion -- has been criticized for using genetically-modified animal food, receiving questionable subsidies and for low compensation to dairy farmers. Theo himself, who is described as bullish, has been pushing many lawsuits against his critics, such as Greenpeace. In November 2015, the use of a half-naked, dark-skinned pinup model on milk bottles in Germany and Austria provoked accusations of sexism and racism. In 1995, two armed men dressed up as policemen unsuccessfully tried to kidnap Mueller. He moved to Erlenbach am Zuerichsee in Switzerland in 2003, so his children wouldn't have to pay taxes when inheriting the company. He has a special interest in supporting music education.
