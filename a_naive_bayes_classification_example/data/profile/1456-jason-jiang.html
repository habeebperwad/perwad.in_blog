					Focus Media was acquired by Hedy Holdings, a listed Chinese computer manufacturer, in a backdoor listing at home in China in 2016. 

				
				
					Focus has largely stayed ahead of the trends in out-of-home advertising in China over the years, most recently profiting from movie theatre shorts a time of box office growth.
