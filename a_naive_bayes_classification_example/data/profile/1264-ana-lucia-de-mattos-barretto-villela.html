			Ana Lucia de Mattos Barretto Villela is among the low-profile members of one of Brazil's oldest banking families and the youngest female billionaire in Brazil. Her great-grandfather founded Itau, one of Brazil's largest banks, which merged with Unibanco in 2008 to form Itau-Unibanco, Latin America's biggest non-state bank.  Ana Lucia's grandfather founded publicly-traded Duratex, a Brazilian maker of wood paneling and bathroom fixtures, which Ana Lucia also owns a stake of. With her billionaire brother, Alfredo, Ana Lucia heads the Alana Institute, a non-profit organization they co-founded in 1994 to promote education and culture for children.   The siblings lost their parents in a plane crash in 1982, and were raised by their aunt, Maria de Lourdes, who was also a billionaire before donating her Itausa shares to sons Ricardo and Rodolfo Villela Marino. Ana Lucia's husband, Marcos Nisti, is CEO of Alana. The couple has two daughters.
