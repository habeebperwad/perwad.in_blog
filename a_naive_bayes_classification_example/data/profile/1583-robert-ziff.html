			Robert Ziff, the second billionaire Ziff brother, is now no longer managing his multi-billion dollar fortune with his brothers Dirk and Daniel. For three decades, the three brothers had managed the family fortune in high profile hedge funds through Ziff Brothers Investments.  In 2014, they shuttered their hedge funds in the United States and London, but are still using Ziff Brothers Investments to manage some of their investments. The brothers are also reportedly investing some of their billions individually with investors who were formerly at their hedge funds but have since started their own shops. The roots of their fortune date back to 1927 when their grandfather William Sr. first started his publishing business. Their father William Jr. built up Ziff Davis, which became best known for such trade publications as PC Magazine and Car and Driver, before selling it for $1.4 billion in 1994.  The brothers have since increased those proceeds by tenfold.
