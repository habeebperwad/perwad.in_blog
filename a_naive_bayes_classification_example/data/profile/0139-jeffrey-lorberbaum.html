			Jeffrey Lorberbaum has built Mohawk Industries, based in Calhoun, Georgia, into the largest flooring company in the world. He has a nearly 15% stake in the publicly-traded tile and carpet manufacturing company.  His father, Alan, founded Aladdin Mills in 1957 as a maker of bath mats; Lorberbaum joined the company in 1976 and later became the CEO. In 1994 the family sold Aladdin to Mohawk Industries. Lorberbaum took charge at Mohawk in 2001 and expanded into hard-surface flooring. In June 2015, Mohawk completed the acquisition of flooring manufacturer IVC Group for $1.2 billion. Lorberbaum was awarded EY's Lifetime Achievement Award in Entrepreneurship in June 2016.
