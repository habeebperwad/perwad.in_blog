			Thomas Peterffy, a pioneer in digital stock trading, runs brokerage business Interactive Brokers Group. He has made himself the company's figurehead and spokesman. Peterffy arrived in America in 1965 as the penniless descendant of Hungarian aristocrats who'd lost nearly all to the Soviets.  He got into electronic trading decades before the exchanges digitized, making his Timber Hill into one of the world's largest market makers. When faster traders emerged in the 2000s and began to torpedo Timber Hill, he pivoted into the brokerage business. (And in March 2017, he announced that Interactive Brokers Group would begin phasing out its options market-making business.) He is the chairman and CEO of Interactive Brokers Group.
