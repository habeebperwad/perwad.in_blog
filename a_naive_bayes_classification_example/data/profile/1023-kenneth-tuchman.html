			Kenneth Tuchman is the chairman and CEO of call center outsourcing giant TeleTech. Tuchman's personal frustration with the difficulties businesses faced when trying to interact with customers led him to found the company in 1982. The company went public in 1986. Tuchman got into business at a young age.  He got his first job at 12, working at a bike shop. Three years later, he started a small venture selling puka shell necklaces to friends. Before long, he was the one of the largest shell importers from the Philippines and was selling millions of necklaces to department stores. "That was really my first look into what it's like to have a start-up business take off into high gear very quickly," Tuchman told FORBES. Tuchman studied architecture at a junior college and had planned to transfer to UCLA. Instead, he dropped out of college to pursue a variety of business ventures before starting TeleTech. Today, the company has 44,000 employees and operates in 80 countries.
