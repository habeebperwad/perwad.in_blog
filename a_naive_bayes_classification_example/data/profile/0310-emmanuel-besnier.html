			Emmanuel Besnier has been called the "French Howard Hughes,"  "the Emperor of Cheese," and, thanks to his disdain for the press, "the invisible billionaire." He's said to shun the media so much that only a handful of photos of him exist.  The oldest of three siblings, Emmanuel is CEO of Lactalis, his family's dairy company based in his ancestral hometown of Laval in western France.  His father founded the company, which sells over $18 billion of products including President brie, Milkmaid yogurts and Valbreso Feta. The biggest dairy producer in Europe, Lactalis continues to expand internationally in places like China and Southeast Asia.  Through the family's holding companies, he, his brother Jean-Michel and sister Marie also own stakes in Italy's publicly traded Parmalat  and Frommageries Bel, the French maker of Baby Bel, La Vache Qui Rit and Boursin.
