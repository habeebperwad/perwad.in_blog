			Sandra Ortega Mera is the daughter of the second-richest person in the world, Amancio Ortega, founder of clothing giant Inditex. She inherited her fortune from her mother Rosalia Mera, who died suddenly in August 2013. Sandra got 89% of Rosp Corunna, the holding company Mera used to invest her wealth.  Now the second-richest person in Spain after her father, Sandra holds a stake in Inditex through Rosp Corunna but is not involved in running the company. Instead she devotes her time to Fundación Paideia, the nonprofit her mother started. The organization supports vocational training for people with mental and physical disabilities and it advocates moving them into mainstream jobs. Sandra's brother Marcos was born with cerebral palsy. She has a psychology degree from the Universidad de Santiago and lives a fiercely private life in the Galician town of La Coruña on the Atlantic coast with her husband and three kids.
