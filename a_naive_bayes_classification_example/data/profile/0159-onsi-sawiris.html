			Onsi Sawiris is the patriarch of Egypt's wealthiest family and founder of Orascom Construction Industries. Following the Egyptian political uprisings in 2011, his son Nassef, who heads the company, moved its listing to Euronext in Amsterdam, renaming it OCI.  Onsi Sawiris still owns nearly a quarter of OCI. In 2015, OCI spun off its construction business, which now trades again on the Egyptian exchange, as well as on Nasdaq Dubai, as Orascom Construction. A scholarship at the University of Chicago bears his name, thanks to a $20 million donation by his son Nassef, a graduate of the school. Both Nassef and son Naguib are billionaires.
