			Friedhelm Loh owns a group of companies that provide software, products and services to a range of industries including switchgear manufacturing, power distribution, steel and plastics. He inherited the business 30 years ago from his father, Rudolf, who founded it in 1961 after inventing the first mass-produced enclosures for electrical control systems.  Today, the group has over 11,500 employees, more than 65 global subsidiaries and annual revenue of around $2.5 billion. The largest company in the group, Rittal, supplies enclosures, climate-control technology, power distribution gear and IT infrastructure. In 2013, Friedhelm Loh Group acquired Kuttig Computeranwendungen GmbH, Cideon AG and Kiesling Maschinentechnik -- companies active in software and engineering. Loh collects antique cars and publishes religious literature through his Christian Media Foundation. He serves as honorary president of ZVEI, a German electronics and electric manufacturers' association. He committed $6.8 million to establish the Rittal Foundation on the company's 50th anniversary in 2011.
