			The son of a dry goods store owner, Stephen Schwarzman rose through the ranks at investment bank Lehman Brothers, then struck out on his own with fellow billionaire Peter Peterson in 1985. The duo named their boutique merger-and-acquisition advisory firm Blackstone -- "Schwarz" means black in German and Yiddish, while "Peter" means stone in Greek.  The business, which later expanded into leveraged buyouts, now manages over $360 billion in assets and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. While Peterson retired from the company in 2008, Schwarzman still runs the world's largest buyout firm as CEO and chairman. An active philanthropist, he has pledged or given away $350 million to Yale U., Chinese university Tsinghua, and the New York Public Library. The high profile billionaire , who chairs Trump's strategic and policy forum, held a high profile 70th birthday party for himself in February 2017 in Palm Beach that reportedly featured camels, acrobats, a performance by Gwen Stefani and such guests as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.
