			Red Bull sold a record of over 6 billion cans in 2016, almost enough to give a caffeine jolt to every human on the planet. The co-founder behind the ubiquitous energy drink is Dietrich Mateschitz, a former marketing executive for German consumer products company Blendax.  Mateschitz introduced the pick-me-up tonic to the international stage after tasting Krating Daeng, another energy drink concocted by Thai businessman Chaleo Yoovidhya (d. 2012). Mateschitz and Yoovidhya partnered to create Red Bull and aggressively invested in marketing to make the brand synonymous with extreme feats. This includes its famous sponsorship of Felix Baumgartner's 120,000-foot skydive in October 2012. Almost 30 years after first peddling the elixir, Red Bull still has plenty of pep. Sales increased 1.8% to $6.43 billion in the latest year.
