			Christoffel Wiese built a retail empire by capitalizing on bargain prices in South Africa, and has expanded its geographic footprint. In December 2015, Wiese's furniture and home goods retailer Steinhoff moved its listing from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to focus on the European market.  In August 2016, Steinhoff entered the U.S. market, announcing plans to buy Mattress Firm Holding Corp., which owns Sleepy's, a chain with 1,000 mattress stores, for $2.4 billion. His other investments include 15% of publicly-traded Shoprite Holdings, which has supermarkets, furniture stores and fast food outlets in 15 countries across Africa and the Indian Ocean Islands; and stakes in private equity firm Brait, industrial products company Invicta Holdings and mining-sector investor Pallinghurst.
