			David Shou-Yeh Wong is chairman of the Dah Sing Group, a leading financial services group in Hong Kong. In June 2016 the group sold its insurance units to a Chinese investor for $1.4 billion, goosing the shares of Hong Kong-listed Dah Sing Financial Holdings and making Wong a billionaire for the first time since 2008. Wong has chaired the group since 1987 and his son Harold Tsu-Hing Wong serves as the managing director of Dah Sing Banking Group, which is the group's other listed unit.
