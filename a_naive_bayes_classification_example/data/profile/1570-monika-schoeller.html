			Monika Schoeller, Stefan von Holtzbrinck and their half-brother Dieter inherited publishing house Verlagsgruppe Holtzbrinck from their father Georg, who founded it as a book club in 1948. Holtzbrinck Publishing Group's business segments include Macmillan Publishers (general fiction and non-fiction) and Holtzbrinck Digital, Information & Services.  The latter includes a venture capital unit that was an early investor in the online clothing retailer Zalando (the Zappos of Europe). In December 2013, continuing an exit from the newspaper business that began in 2009, the group sold its remaining 49% interest in the daily Suedkurier to Mediengruppe Pressedruck. (It still has a 50% stake in the weekly paper Die Zeit). In 2015, Holtzbrinck agreed to combine the majority of Macmillan Science and Education with Springer Science+Business Media, a scientific, technical and medical publisher owned by private equity investors. Holtzbrinck contributed various science, scholarly and education-business brands including Macmillan Education Language Learning, one of the world's largest publishers of English Language Teaching (ELT) material; the journals Scientific American (founded in 1845) and Nature (1869); and Palgrave Macmillan, a humanities and social sciences publisher. Holtzbrinck owns 53% of the joint venture, called Springer Nature, now the world's largest academic book publisher. Schoeller is publisher and sits on the management board of Holtzbrinck's S. Fischer Verlag, which dates back to 1886 (it was the original publisher of Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka and Hermann Hesse).
