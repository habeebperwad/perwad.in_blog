			One of Britain's wealthiest high street fashion moguls, Day decided to skip college in order to start working for a British clothing manufacturer. He joined Edinburgh Woolen Mill in 2001 and bought the company outright the next year.  When he bought the retailer, it was an ailing fashion company that was barely making profits. He turned it around, acquired other struggling retailers and expanded the company to greater heights. His big break came in 2012 when it bought Peacocks, one of the UK's largest fashion retailers after it filed for bankruptcy. He worked diligently to turn around the loss-making retailer and when Peacocks finally recovered in 2014, Day found himself extremely wealthy. Edinburgh Woolen Mill generated $695 million in annual revenue in 2015 through a network of more than 500 stores across the United Kingdom. In his free time, Day is an outdoorsman who takes part in shooting activities and even sat on the board of his local soccer club, Carlisle United, for some time.
