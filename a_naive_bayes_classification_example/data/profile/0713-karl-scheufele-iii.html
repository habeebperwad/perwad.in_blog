			Karl Scheufele III and his family, owners of Swiss jewelry and watchmaker Chopard, have helped transform the brand into one of the most well-known luxury accessory lines in the world. Trained as a goldsmith and watchmaker, by age 20, German-born Scheufele was already running Karl Scheufele GMBH.  In 1963 Scheufele bought a small Geneva-based watchmaker from Paul-Andr√© Chopard and merged the 2 businesses. Today Scheufele and his wife, Karin, remain active in the firm while their children are co-presidents: Caroline Scheufele is responsible for the women's collections and special jewelry, brother Karl-Friedrich Scheufele for the men's collections and factory operations. With more than 100 boutiques worldwide, Chopard's jewelry is a regular on the red carpet -- 11 Academy Award nominees have won while wearing Chopard, most recently Julianne Moore.
