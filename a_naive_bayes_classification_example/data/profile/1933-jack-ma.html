			Jack Ma has built e-commerce firm Alibaba into a behemoth. Its IPO in New York in 2014 set a record as the world's biggest public stock offering. Though dogged by criticism that Alibaba doesn't do enough to limit the sale of fakes, Ma is leading Alibaba to ever higher sales.  A record $463 billion of business transactions were conducted on Alibaba's retail platforms in the fiscal year through March 2016. The company set a goal of creating 10 million profitable businesses and 100 million jobs in the next 20 years. Ma made headlines at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January, when he told CNBC that America has no one to blame but itself for its economic issues. Beyond e-commerce, in October 2016 Alibaba's film unit forged an alliance with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners, giving a potential boost to a struggling effort so far in the entertainment industry.
