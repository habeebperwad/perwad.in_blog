			Denise Coates is co-CEO of Bet365, one of the world's largest online gambling companies, along with her billionaire brother, John. She started out working for her father, crunching numbers in his betting shops while still in school.  After training as an accountant, she took over some of those shops, turning around their fortunes before selling them to large bookmaker Coral. Noting the success of online gambling businesses, Coates bought the domain Bet365.com in 2000 and launched the website in 2001. She owns around half of privately held Bet365, which had $2 billion in revenues and facilitated $45 billion in bets in the year through March 2016. The company also owns a majority stake in the Stoke City Football Club. In 2015, Bet365 moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its favorable regulations.
