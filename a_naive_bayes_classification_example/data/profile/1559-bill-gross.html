			Star bond investor Bill Gross decamped from money manager Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) in 2014 and now manages about $1.9 billion at Janus Capital, roughly half of which is his money. Gross says he was fired; PIMCO says he resigned.  That disagreement is crucial. In October 2015, Gross sued PIMCO for wrongful dismissal, seeking $200 million in damages that he says he will donate to charity. PIMCO tried to get the suit thrown out, but a California judge ruled it could proceed. A jury trial is scheduled for September 2017. Gross, who studied psychology at Duke, cofounded PIMCO in 1971 and led it for more than 4 decades. In January 2016 Gross and his wife pledged $40 million to the University of California at Irvine to create a nursing school. An avid stamp collector, Gross is said to have one of the most impressive collections on the planet.
