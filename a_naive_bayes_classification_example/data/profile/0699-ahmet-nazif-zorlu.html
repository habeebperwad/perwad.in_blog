			Haci Mehmet Zorlu laid the foundations of Zorlu Holding, now Turkey's leading exporter, in 1953 by establishing a business weaving bed sheets on a homemade loom in his hometown of Denizli, in southwestern Turkey.  In the 1960s, sons Zeki Zorlu and Ahmet Nazif Zorlu expanded the retail side of the business, initiated contract manufacturing and launched the home textiles brand TAC. Zorlu entered the energy business in 1993 to power its textile production, then diversified further into consumer electronics and appliances (marketed under the brand name Vestel), nickel mining, real estate development and hotels. In 2013, after an investment of $2.5 billion, Zorlu Holding completed Zorlu Center, which includes residences, offices, a shopping mall and hotel in the Zincirlikuyu neighborhood of Istanbul. A high school dropout, Ahmet shuttles around Europe in a custom-designed helicopter. He owns a private island off the Turkish coast.
