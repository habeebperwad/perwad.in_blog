			A trained economist, Gleb Fetisov joined Alfa Group in 1995. He first worked at the food-and-commodity-trading division, Alfa Eco, and later led the group's takeover of an aluminum plant in Siberia. He also became a lobbyist and a member of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament. Fetisov sold all of his business interests in 2014 including a stake in telecom outfit Vimpelcom for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. He then left the business world to become a full-time opposition politician as founder of the Green Alliance Party. He was arrested soon after, accused of embezzling assets of now-bankrupt My Bank in Moscow. He paid $200 million to creditors in February 2015. In August that year, he was released from prison, and at the end of 2015, he announced he was leaving politics. In the end of 2016 he said he registered a company named FIFA Entertainment in Hollywood and will start producing movies soon.
