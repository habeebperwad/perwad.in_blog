Richard oversees managed funds and investment in New York and London; Stephen looks after bond holdings; and Michael is in charge of equities.  His daughter, Cathy, breeds racehorses, and his other son, Paul, founded online magazine Aeon in London. A former engineer, Hains stopped working for seven years in the late 1960s to improve his golf game with legendary Australian coach Norman von Nida. He later became known for restructuring companies such as U.S. steelmaker Wheeling-Pittsburgh. He bred the 1990 Melbourne Cup winner Kingston Rule.
