			Richard DeVos is the cofounder of direct-selling giant Amway. He grew up in the Great Depression and made his first sale (a few pennies) driving through his neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Mich. with his grandfather in a Model T.  In high school he offered his friend Jay Van Andel (d. 2004) 25 cents a week for rides in his car. DeVos' and Van Andel's first business together was a drive-in diner. They eventually struck it big with Amway (short for "American Way"), which they started in 1959, selling multipurpose cleaner door-to-door. DeVos retired in 1993. Today the $8.8 billion (sales) company, now under the corporate umbrella of Alticor after a reorganization in 2000, is run by his children. DeVos and his family are staunch supporters of Republican causes and his daughter-in-law, Betsy Devos, was appointed U.S. Secretary of Education under the Trump administration in February 2017. DeVos is also the owner of the NBA's Orlando Magic and a minority owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
