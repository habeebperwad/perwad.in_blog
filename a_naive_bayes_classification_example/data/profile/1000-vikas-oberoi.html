			IIndian property magnate Vikas Oberoi, who counts Morgan Stanley as an early backer of his Mumbai-focused Oberoi Realty, returns to the Forbes billionaire ranks after dropping off last year, on share gains and new information on his private assets. The firm, which owns a Westin hotel in suburban Mumbai, is building the city's first Ritz-Carlton hotel and residences, due to open in 2018. Last year Oberoi, who is not related to the family behind the Oberoi hotel chain, received approval to develop a 4-acre midtown plot that he personally owns; he plans to build a mall, hotel and serviced apartments.
