It was the crowning achievement for Dolan, who got his start cutting sports highlight reels for TV stations around his native Cleveland.  He still owns stakes in Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers and AMC Networks. His brother Larry owns the Cleveland Indians baseball team. Charles chairs the Lustgarten Foundation, the largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research in the country.
