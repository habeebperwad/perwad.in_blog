			William Fisher, one of three sons of Gap founders Donald and Doris Fisher, helped export the brand to Canada, Japan and Europe as the founding executive of its international division. He still sits on the board of the company his parents started as a jeans-and-music store in 1969. He also founded Manzanita Capital, a London-based private equity firm, in 2001 and serves at its CEO.  Like his billionaire brothers, he attended Princeton as an undergrad before going to Stanford for business school; he now sits on Stanford's School of Business Advisory Council. He frequently donates to Stanford, where he and wife Sakurako have endowed a professorship. Sakurako is the president of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and supports the Smithsonian.
