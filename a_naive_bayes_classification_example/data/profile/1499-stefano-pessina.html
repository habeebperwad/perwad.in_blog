			Nearly four decades after taking over his family's pharmaceutical wholesaler in Naples, Italy, Stefano Pessina heads the world's largest drugstore chain, Walgreens Boots Alliance. He got there by striking a flurry of deals, buying more than 150 rival pharmacies across Europe, then merging his UniChem Group with U. K. pharmacy Alliance Boots and taking the company private in a $22 billion deal, Europe's largest leveraged buyout ever. Between 2012 and 2014, Walgreens bought 100% of his pharmacy chain, creating Walgreens Boots Alliance and making Pessina the largest shareholder in the Chicago-based company. In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced its intent to acquire drugstore rival Rite Aid for $17 billion. Pessina took over as CEO two months later. As of mid-March 2017, the merger with Rite Aid had not yet closed due to antitrust concerns.
