			Under Armour founder Kevin Plank made his billions as the underdog competitor to Nike. In July 2016, Plank announced plans to move Under Armour's flagship store to the old F.A.O. Schwarz building on Fifth Avenue in New York City.  In Baltimore, he's building a 4 million-square-foot headquarters for Under Armour. It's part of a much larger development plan, called Port Covington, which will include shopping, hotels, offices and 9,000 residential units. The youngest of five boys who grew up in Kensington, Maryland, Plank got kicked out of his high school after an alcohol-fueled brawl with Georgetown football players and later walked onto the University of Maryland's football team after college recruiters passed over him. Sitting in packed locker rooms after games, he noticed his teammates were all wearing heavy, sweat-soaked shirts. So he came up with a lightweight, sweat-wicking shirt using fabrics from women's undergarments. After graduating in 1996 he set himself up in the basement of his deceased grandmother's house and started selling them. exaggerating to early customers to make the company sound bigger than it was. Under Armour is now America's second biggest sportswear vendor behind Nike.
