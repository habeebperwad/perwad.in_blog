			Blinds baron Ralph Sonnenberg is chairman and CEO of Netherlands-based Hunter Douglas Group. His father founded the maker of window coverings and architectural products in 1919 as a machine-tool manufacturer; eventually the company developed the technology for the production of flexible aluminum slats for Venetian blinds.  The company doesn't just supply homeowners--the world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower, sports blinds and ceiling systems by Hunter Douglas. Sonnenberg owns upwards of 80% of the company's stock, and his sons Marko and David work for Hunter Douglas.
