			Dan Snyder's sports team, the Washington Redskins, unveiled an early plan in March for a 60,000-seat stadium that will include a moat for kayakers, a tailgating park and a museum. Snyder bought the NFL team for $800 million in 1999. It has earned only 3 division titles since and no trips to the Super Bowl, but is now worth $2.95 billion thanks to league TV deals and sponsorship agreements.  Despite years of controversy, Snyder refuses to consider changing the Redskins' name. His fortune stems from a marketing business he started after dropping out of college; it initially sold advertisements pinned on bulletin boards and distributed product samples. In 1996, he took the company public, making the then 32-year-old the youngest CEO on the New York Stock Exchange at the time. French company Havas bought the business for $2.5 billion in 2000.
