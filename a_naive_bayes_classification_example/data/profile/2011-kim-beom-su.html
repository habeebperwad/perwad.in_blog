			"Brian" Kim Beom-Su hit the jackpot with KakaoTalk, which has tens of millions of users using it for gaming, shopping and chatting. In 2014 the free smartphone messaging service announced plans to purchase publicly traded Internet company Daum Communications in an all-stock transaction, thus avoiding an IPO.  In January 2016 it bought a majority stake in music outfit Loen Entertainment. Kim still owns more than 30% of Kakao. Not bad for someone whose parents didn't make it past grade school, and who grew up in poverty. He paid his way through Seoul National University by offering private tutoring, sometimes skipping meals to save money. After finishing with undergraduate and master's degrees in industrial engineering, Kim worked at Samsung before founding online gaming company Hangame in 1998. He merged that company with another Korean Internet outfit, Naver, in 2000, creating NHN, which would come to dominate the country's search and Web portal traffic. When smartphones arrived around 2009, he hit upon the idea of creating a messaging service that would outshine utilitarian SMS texts. He launched KakaoTalk a year later.
