					He took the firm public in 2007, but stepped down as the chairman in late 2013 and stepped away from the business completely in 2015 after a series of controversies.
				
				
					In 2013, Wilson's blaming Lululemon's too sheer pants on women's body types caused an uproar among fans.
				
				
					Although Wilson has no management role in Lululemon, he remains its biggest individual shareholder.
