			Jeffrey Lurie is a PhD-holding former professor, but he's more widely known as the outspoken owner of the Philadelphia Eagles. After earning his doctoral degree at Brandeis, Lurie taught social policy at Boston University before taking an executive role at General Cinema Corporation, the film company founded by his grandfather.  He then started Chestnut Hill Productions in 1985, where he produced a string of mostly forgettable movies. In 1994 he took out a loan to buy the Philadelphia Eagles for $185 million. Despite having to give up a stake in the Eagles during his 2012 divorce, his stake in the $2.5 billion team still represents the bulk of his fortune.
