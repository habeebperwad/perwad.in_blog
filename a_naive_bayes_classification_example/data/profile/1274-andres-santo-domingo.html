			When Julio Mario Santo Domingo died in 2011, he passed down a massive stake in beer giant SABMiller, which owns brands such as Miller Lite, Milwaukee's Best and Leinenkugel's, to his sons, Alejandro and Andres Santo Domingo.  Both are now billionaires, though Alejandro serves as the public face of the family fortune. Their niece and nephew, Tatiana Casiraghi and Julio Mario Santo Domingo III, are also billionaires. Andres has roots in Colombia and investments around the world, but his life is centered in America. He graduated from Brown University in 2000 and reportedly founded small-time record label Kemado Records two years later. His wife, Lauren, is a contributing editor at Vogue and the founder of Moda Operandi, an online retailer that lets customers buy runway clothes before they land in stores. He has given over $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
