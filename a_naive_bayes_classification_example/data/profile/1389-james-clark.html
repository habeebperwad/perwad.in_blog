			Jim Clark cofounded Netscape but has since multiplied his wealth through timely tech investments. He got in early on Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Palantir.  A former Stanford professor, he's now retired and lives with his wife, Kristy Hinze, a former Victoria's Secret and Sports Illustrated model, and their young daughter.  He collects wine and art -- including works by Monet and Matisse, and a 30,000-bottle Burgundy collection he calls his "liquid asset." An ocean lover, Clark's yachts include the 300-foot sailing yacht Athena and the 100-foot racing sailboat Comanche. Clark was the key financial backer of the Japanese dolphin hunting documentary "The Cove," as well as the namesake behind Stanford's James H. Clark Bio-X Center, a 146,000-square-foot research complex.
