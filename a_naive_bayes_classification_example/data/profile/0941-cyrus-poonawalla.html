			Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla founded Serum Institute of India in 1966 and went on to make it one of the world's largest vaccine makers by volume, producing 1.3 billion doses annually. Serum, which son Adar helps him run, reported a record profit of $360 million on revenue of $695 million in the last fiscal year ended March 2016 but sales have since flatlined amid increased competition.  Poonawalla is investing $150 million in a new factory to make a range of vaccines, including for dengue, pneumonia and diarrhea. Serum, which owns Dutch vaccine maker Bilthoven Biologicals, is eyeing expansion in Europe and is close to acquiring a vaccine producer in Prague. Poonawalla recently contributed $2.5 million for a hospital named after his late wife, to treat the underprivileged.
