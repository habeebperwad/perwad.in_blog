			AOL founder Steve Case's investment company, Revolution, is betting on the future of tech outside of Silicon Valley. The company has backed startups like Washington, D.C.-based LivingSocial and Sweetgreen, as well as Austin, Texas-based Bigcommerce.  Recent investments include DraftKings, a Boston-based online fantasy sports contest provider. Born and raised in Hawaii, Case attended the prestigious Punahou School, where former President Barack Obama also went to high school. In 1985, Case helped found Quantum Computer Services. He became CEO in 1991 and changed its name to America Online. AOL merged with Time Warner in 2001 in a $164 billion deal that was eventually deemed one of the worst mergers in history. Case chairs Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, a nonprofit he founded with his late brother, Dan. His Case Foundation is devoted to employing the Internet for more effective and efficient philanthropy.
