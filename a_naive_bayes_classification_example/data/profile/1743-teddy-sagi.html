			Israeli entrepreneur Teddy Sagi lives in Tel Aviv but has a strong U.K. ties to many of his assets. He founded gambling software developer Playtech in 1999 and has built it into a nearly $700 million (sales) operation, which trades on London's AIM stock exchange.  Sagi sold a 12% slice of Playtech for almost $400 million in 2016; he still owns about 21% of the company. He also owns a stake in Market Tech, which in turn owns 11 acres of London real estate including tourist hot spot Camden Market. Market Tech went public in December 2014. In addition, he took two other ventures public on London's AIM exchange: SafeCharge, an online payments processor that counts gambling and gaming companies as its primary clients, and Crossrider, which uses big data to analyze digital advertising. Sagi owns at least two-thirds of each company.
