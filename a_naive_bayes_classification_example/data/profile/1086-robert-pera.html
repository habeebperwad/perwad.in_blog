			Robert Pera's wireless equipment maker, Ubiquiti Networks, entered the consumer tech market in May 2016 with its $199 home Wi-Fi router. The bulk of its products provide Wi-Fi connections to businesses. In 2015, Ubiquiti announced that one of its products broke a world distance record for wireless broadband: a 140-mile-long reliable connection between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Pera also owns the Memphis Grizzlies, which struck a reported $153 million deal to re-sign guard Mike Conley, the priciest contract in NBA history, in July 2016. Pera got his start at Apple in 2003 but struck out on his own two years later. He became a billionaire less than a decade later, in 2011.
