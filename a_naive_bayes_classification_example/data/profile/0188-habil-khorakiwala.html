			Pharma tycoon Habil Khorakiwala chairs Wockhardt, a pharma company he founded in 1967 after breaking away from his family's storied retailing empire. Today it is among India's top generics makers, getting two thirds of its $666 million annual revenue from overseas.  Sales in the U.S. have dipped because of continuing quality problems at several of its factories. Younger son Murtaza runs the company. Daughter Zahabiya oversees the hospital arm while another son heads the charitable foundation.
