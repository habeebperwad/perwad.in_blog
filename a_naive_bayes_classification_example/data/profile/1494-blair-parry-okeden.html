			Blair Parry-Okeden is the granddaughter of James M. Cox, who founded what has become Cox Enterprises, an automotive and media conglomerate. James -- twice governor of Ohio and failed Democratic presidential candidate in 1920 -- started the company.  Parry-Okeden's stepfather ran it for a time, and now her brother, Jim, a billionaire in his own right, manages the massive firm. She herself has no role there and lives much as her mother did -- in seclusion. After growing up in Hawaii, she now lives in the small town of Scone, Australia, a village in a rural part of the country known for its horse farms. She lived in almost complete anonymity until the 2007 death of her mother, Barbara Cox Anthony, made her a billionaire.
