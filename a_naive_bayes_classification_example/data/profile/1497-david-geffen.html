			David Geffen made a fortune from music and the movies. A college dropout, he used a fake UCLA degree to land a mailroom job at the William Morris Agency. Geffen later founded Asylum Records and Geffen Records, launching careers of bands including The Eagles, Aerosmith and Guns N' Roses.  In 1990 he sold Asylum to MCA for $550 million. Four years later, with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, he raised $2 billion to start movie studio DreamWorks SKG. No longer involved in the entertainment business, he is focusing on investments outside Hollywood, including his contemporary art collection, which includes works by Jasper Johns, Willem De Kooning and Jackson Pollock. In April 2016, he donated $100 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, which will name a new wing for him. In 2015, the Lincoln Center unveiled the David Geffen Hall, formerly known as Avery Fisher Hall, after Geffen gave $100 million for the hall's renovation.
