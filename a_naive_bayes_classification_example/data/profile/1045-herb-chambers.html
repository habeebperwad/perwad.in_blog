			Herb Chambers dominates the New England auto sales market. His 55 dealerships bring in more than $2.5 billion per year and are a magnet for customers who covet luxury rides like Bentley, Rolls Royce, Maserati and Lamborghini.  An avowed car fanatic -- he owns vintage Ferraris and a rare McLaren F1 -- he prefers his helicopter when commuting from Connecticut to his Somerville, MA headquarters. Chambers grew up in Boston's working-class Dorchester neighborhood, where he got his first job as a cart collector at the local supermarket. He later dropped out of high school during his senior year and joined the U.S. Navy. After returning, he borrowed $500 from his mother to start his first company, a copy distributor, which sold for $80 million in 1983. Chambers then stumbled into the car sales business, purchasing a Cadillac dealership that had given him poor service. Thirty years later, he is a billionaire, with a gleaming 200 foot yacht to prove it.
