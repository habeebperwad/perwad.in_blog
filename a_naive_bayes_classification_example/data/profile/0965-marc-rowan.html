			Marc Rowan is cofounder of Apollo Global Management, a private equity behemoth worth billions. Since the firm went public in 2011, Rowan has sold a large number of shares, far more than fellow founders Leon Black and Joshua Harris.  He has used the cash to start a billion dollar family investment firm, RWN Management, and to make a string of high-profile real estate purchases, including a host of properties in the swanky Hamptons region of Long Island. In May 2016 he opened Arbor Restaurant in Montauk, following his purchase of the nearby Neptune Motel the previous winter. Rowan also recently took control of the iconic Duryea's Lobster Deck; he originally planned to raze much of the compound, but backed off after community pushback. Rowan attended the University of Pennsylvania before taking a job in M&A at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. When Drexel collapsed in scandal, he, Black, and Harris struck out on their own to found Apollo.
