			Orion Hindawi cofounded cybersecurity firm Tanium with his father David in 2007. The duo previously started BigFix, an IT software patching system that they sold to IBM for $400 million in 2010. By then, the Hindawis already had moved on to Tanium, building the software in secret for five years before unveiling a new, super-fast way to scan and control security across thousands of networked computers in a company.  In September 2015, they raised $120 million from investors who valued Tanium at $3.5 billion. In February 2016, Orion took over as CEO from his father, but in practice he is co-managing Tanium with his dad. In November, Orion said in a media interview that Tanium may go public in 2017. Orion's father David was born in Baghdad, grew up in Israel, and went to UC Berkeley to earn a PhD. Orion also ended up at Berkeley in 1997, but dropped out before graduating to work with his father.
