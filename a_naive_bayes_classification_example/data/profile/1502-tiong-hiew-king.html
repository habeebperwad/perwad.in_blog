			Timber baron Tiong Hiew King holds forestry concessions in 16 countries. Also holds property, oil-and-gas and palm-oil interests, and runs a print and digital media business for Chinese-language consumers.  His four dailies comprise nearly 70% of Malaysia's Chinese newspaper sales and three-quarters of advertising revenue. Most valuable asset is his privately held Oregon Group, which is based in New Zealand and builds housing developments and hotels, harvests salmon and logs and manufactures plastic containers. As a teenager Tiong tapped rubber to support his poor family before building his empire. He's an avid practitioner of tai chi.
