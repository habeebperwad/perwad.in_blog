			Veteran Mumbai investor Radhakishan Damani, who is also a mentor to billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, makes his debut buoyed by the recent IPO of his hypermarket chain DMart. He holds stakes in a range of companies, from tobacco firm VST industries to cement maker India Cements.  His property portfolio includes the 156-room Radisson Blu Resort in Alibag, a popular beach-front getaway close to Mumbai. Low profile Damani rarely makes appearances at public events and avoids speaking to the press.
