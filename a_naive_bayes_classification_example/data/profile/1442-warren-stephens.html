			Warren Stephens was a newsprint holdout, but finally gave up on the newspaper business in 2015, selling more than a dozen titles he controlled, including the Las Vegas Review-Journal for almost $400 million.  (The buyer of the Las Vegas Review-Journal: casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson.) Add it to a history of profitable exits, including in 2012 when Stephens sold Viking Range for $380 million. Stephens Inc., his Little Rock investment bank, was founded by his uncle, Witt Stephens, in 1933 with $15,000. His father Jackson joined in 1946. The brothers paid $5.4 million for Arkansas-Oklahoma Gas in 1954, which has since evolved into natural gas driller Stephens Production. They underwrote Wal-Mart's public offering in 1970. The brothers plowed their earnings into private equity, hewing to the investment criteria, "whim and caprice." Warren grew up in the business, became CEO in 1986 and bought out his cousins in 2006. A golf nut (his dad was chairman of Augusta National for years), Warren in 2004 built the Alotian Club outside Little Rock; it is ranked one of America's best.
