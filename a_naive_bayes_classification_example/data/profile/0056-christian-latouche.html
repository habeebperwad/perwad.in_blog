			Christian Latouche is the founder, owner and CEO of Fiducial SA, a global accounting firm with $1.6 billion in annual revenues. Fiducial began as a one-man show in 1970, when Latouche bought a small accounting business in southern France and launched a company then known as Sofinarex.  His vision was simple: to provide the world's smallest companies with the same high-quality accounting and tax consultancy services that large corporations received. Through acquisitions, Latouche eventually built Fiducial into an accounting and business services giant with more than 17,500 employees across 1,145 offices in 78 countries. Media-shy Latouche rarely gives interviews and shuns all publicity. He plans to keep the company in family hands.
