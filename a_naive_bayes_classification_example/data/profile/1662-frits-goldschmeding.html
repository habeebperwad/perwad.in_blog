			The bulk of Frits Goldschmeding's fortune comes from his estimated 32% stake in staffing company Randstad Holding, an industry leader with branches in 39 countries. In 2016 the company spent more than $400 million purchasing job hunting site Monster. com. Goldschmeding founded the business in 1960 and called it Uitzendbureau Amstelveen, then changed the name to Randstad four years later. Within a decade his company had 32 offices in four countries, including Belgium, Germany and the U.K. He took the company public in 1990, then retired in 1998, prior to merging with Vedior in 2008 and becoming the world's second largest recruitment agency. Goldschmeding later put his skills to use as a professor at the Centre for Entrepreneurship of the Nyenrode Business University until 2014. He now resides in Amsterdam and enjoys sailing in his free time.
