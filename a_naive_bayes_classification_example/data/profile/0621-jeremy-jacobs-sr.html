			Jeremy Jacobs concessions juggernaut is still battling Yosemite National Park over naming rights, but made a number of acquisitions in 2016 to try to compensate for the lost income, which paid off with annual revenues rising to $3.2 billion from $3 billion last year.  As Delaware's Chairman, Jacobs has announced a partnership to develop 1.5 million square feet of real estate near Boston's TD Garden, home of his Boston Bruins. Indeed, the business has come a long way since his father started selling popcorn and peanuts in 1915. A graduate of the University at Buffalo, Jacobs pledged $30 million to the college's medical program in 2015, which named its school of medicine in his honor. In 2016, he opened a Florida restaurant with golf legend Jack Nicklaus, an old friend with whom he shares a birthday.
