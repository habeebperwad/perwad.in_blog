			Ted Alfond's father traded his Dexter Shoe Company to Warren Buffett in exchange for a chunk of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1993. The Alfonds have made billions from the rising value of those shares. Harold Alfond, a onetime factory worker who never went to college, sold his first shoe factory, Norrwock Shoe Company, for $1 million in 1944. Fourteen years later, he bought an old mill in Dexter, Maine and turned it into the Dexter Shoe Company, which eventually sold millions of boots and causal shoes a year.  After trading the company to Buffett in 1993, he turned his attention to philanthropy, donating millions to universities and hospitals across Maine before he died in 2007. Son Ted and his three billionaire siblings share the fortune, including Berkshire stock and a small stake in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool FC plus stakes in Roush Fenway Racing and the New England Sports Network.
