			Albert Berner seemed destined to take over his father's butcher shop in the small town of Kuenzelsau, in southern Germany, until one day when he realized his dream was to become a salesman. "From that day on," he recounts in his memoir, My Way | My Life, "I sorted out my life.  I became punctual, orderly and hard-working; the best looking and cleanest guy in town." From a one-man screw business founded in 1957, when Berner was just 21, his namesake company has become a major player in the European Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) market, with approximately 9,000 employees and annual revenue of more than $1 billion.  A leading direct seller to the construction and automotive industries -- fasteners are still an important part of its business --  Berner Group also is active in the development, manufacture and marketing of specialty chemical products and accessories for finishing, cleaning and maintenance. Berner withdrew from the day-to-day operations in 1997 but remains Chairman of the Supervisory Board. His son Christian took over as CEO in 2012, at age 27.
