			Billionaire heiress Tatiana Casiraghi joined Monaco's royal family in 2013, after marrying Andrea Casiraghi, who is reportedly second in line to the throne. She knew great wealth long before her wedding: Her grandfather Julio Mario Santo Domingo had owned Colombian brewery Bavaria before trading it for 15% of SABMiller in 2005. Six years later he died, leaving one-sixth of his inheritance to Tatiana and an equal amount to her billionaire brother Julio Mario Santo Domingo III, a DJ in New York.  Her uncles Alejandro and Andres Santo Domingo each inherited a third of the fortune, as well. Tatiana and Julio Mario III's father Julio Mario Santo Domingo Jr. died in 2009. Alejandro is the public face of the family and continues to manage its money.
