			In 1927, Sylvia Stroeher's grandfather, Franz Stroeher, a wig maker, bought the rights to a process that used hot curlers and chemicals to put-long lasting waves into women's hair. She received around $1 billion from the 2003 sale of her remaining 25% stake in his legacy, hair-care group Wella AG, to Procter & Gamble.  Sylvia Stroeher and her husband, a former nurse, have a well-known collection of contemporary German art -- approximately 1,500 pieces, including works by Baselitz, Immendorff and Kiefer -- part of which is housed in the Museum Kueppersmuhle in Duisburg, Germany. As reported in 2013, she helped struggling German publishing house Suhrkamp by paying writers' remuneration for some time and now sits on its supervisory board.
