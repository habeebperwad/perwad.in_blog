			Eva Gonda Rivera is the widow of Eugenio Garza Laguera, the former chair of FEMSA, Latin America's biggest independent Coca-Cola bottler and distributor. It has operations in 9 Latin American countries. Eugenio, who died in 2008, left his large stake in FEMSA to his wife Eva and four daughters.  The company acquired Farmacias Farmacon, a leading pharmacy chain in northern Mexico, in 2014 for an undisclosed price. FEMSA, whose stock is traded both in Mexico and on the New York Stock Exchange, has been seeking to replicate with drugstores its very successful convenience store business, Oxxo, which has more than 13,000 stores across the country. Gonda Rivera and her daughters avoid the spotlight in Mexico. One of her daughters, Eva Maria Garza Laguera Gonda, is married to Jose Antonio Fernandez Carbajal, the CEO and president of FEMSA.
