			Daryl Katz amassed a fortune in the pharmacy business, buying the Canadian rights to U.S. franchise Medicine Shoppe in 1991. A few years later, he snatched up struggling Canadian drugstore chain Rexall, and expanded to the U.  S. market with the acquisitions of Snyders Drug Store and Drug Emporium. His eponymous Katz Group has since sold off all of its pharmacy operations. Now the Edmonton native is focused on his second act, which may indeed became his ultimate legacy--revitalizing his native city's downtown. His group has been co-developing a $2 billion, 25-acre complex that will include hotel, condo and office towers, among other things, and will be one of Canada's largest mixed-use developments. Phase one is expected to be completed by 2020. An 18,500-seat arena, operated by Katz but owned by the city, opened in the fall of 2016 to house his NHL team, the Edmonton Oilers.
