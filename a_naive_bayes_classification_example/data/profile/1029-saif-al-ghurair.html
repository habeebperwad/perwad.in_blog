			Saif Al Ghurair is the former chairman of family holding company Al Ghurair Group. He and his brother Abdulla, also a billionaire, are scions of an old Dubai merchant family that originally harvested pearls from the Arabian Gulf.  A stormy boat trip to India in the 1930s to sell dates left him blind in one eye. Saif's six sons hold positions in the group, which has interests in banking, steel and packaging. His son Abdulrahman is chairman and son Majid is chief executive. Saif owns nearly 40% of Mashreq Bank, a leading Emirati bank run by his nephew, Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair.
