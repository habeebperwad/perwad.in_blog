			Remo Ruffini turned around a nearly bankrupt luxury sportswear firm Moncler, taking the company public in 2013 in one of Italy's largest IPOs in years. Originally founded in 1952 by two French mountaineers, Moncler found success as its down jackets became popular on the slopes, particularly after the company sponsored the French ski team in the 1968 Winter Olympics at Grenoble.  Around the year 2000, Moncler found itself near bankruptcy amid stiff competition from sportswear companies like the North Face. In 1999 Remo Ruffini became the company's creative director and a few years later bought the brand for an undisclosed amount. Ruffini got his start in the U.S. working for his father's clothing company, Gianfranco Ruffini; his only higher education consisted of a single marketing class at Boston University. He returned to Italy in 1984 and founded his own brand, New England Company, which was sold in 2000 to the Stefanel Group. At Moncler, Ruffini introduced new colors and designs, and partnered with the Carlyle Group to expand internationally. Ruffini still owns a 20% stake and remains chairman and CEO. He owns a 180-foot superyacht, the Atlante, as well as a restored chalet in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
