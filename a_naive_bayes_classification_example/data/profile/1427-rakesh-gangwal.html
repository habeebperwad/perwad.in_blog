			Airline veteran Rakesh Gangwal made his fortune from InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of his budget airline IndiGo, India's largest by market share. The company went public in November 2015. The Indian born mechanical engineer studied at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur before getting his M. B.A. at Wharton. He started his airline career with United Airlines in 1984 in strategic planning, then worked briefly for Air France. He went on to run US Airways Group as its chief executive and chairman. Gangwal cofounded IndiGo, headquartered outside Delhi, alongside pal Rahul Bhatia (also a billionaire) in 2006 with one aircraft. The Miami resident owns more than 40% of the company and now serves as a board member.
