			Gustavo Cisneros and his family own the Cisneros Group, a Florida-based conglomerate with interests in Venezuelan television stations, telecom, a brewery, real estate and a baseball team. Gustavo's daughter, Adriana, became CEO in 2013 and oversaw the restructuring of the group into four main branches: media, interactive, real estate and products & services.  In February 2016, the company broke ground on Tropicalia, a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic expected to open in 2018. In October 2016, Gustavo and his wife, Patricia, gave more than 100 pieces from their collection of Latin American art to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The donation followed an earlier gift of 40 works and will be used to found a research institute for Latin American art in 2017. Gustavo Cisneros, a descendant of Cubans, has been a vocal proponent for the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba.
