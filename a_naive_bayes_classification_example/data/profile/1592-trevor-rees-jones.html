			With plenty of dry powder from nearly a decade of deals, Trevor Rees-Jones has been taking advantage of the oil bust by picking up assets in the Permian Basin of Texas. Rees-Jones got his start as a bankruptcy attorney.  In 1984 he decided to get in the oil business, and eventually became a shale fracking pioneer. His Chief Oil & Gas' first success was in the Barnett shale of Fort Worth, where in 2006 he and his partners sold a bunch of land, wells and pipelines to Devon and Crosstex for $2.6 billion. Next came a JV with Ross Perot, Jr. which they sold in 2008 to Quicksilver. Within a couple years he cleared $2 billion more selling acreage to the likes of Chevron, and another $1 billion dealing his Marcellus pipeline network to Penn-Virginia in 2012. Chief Oil now operates 210,000 acres pumping out roughly 800 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. His Rees-Jones Foundation supports Dallas charities and has donated $25 million each to new Museum of Nature & Science and Boy Scouts, $19 million to establish the Rees-Jones Center for Foster Care Excellence at the Children's Medical Center. "There's got to be a higher purpose to serve in this life," he says.
