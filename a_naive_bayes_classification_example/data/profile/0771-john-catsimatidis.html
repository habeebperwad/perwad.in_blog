			John Catsimatidis moved with his family from Greece to New York when he was an infant and grew up in an apartment in Harlem. He worked as a grocery clerk while attending NYU but dropped out for the chance to own a piece of that shop.  He opened his own grocery store in 1969 and had 10 stores by age 25. In addition to the Gristedes supermarket chain, he owns oil refinery United Refining in Pennsylvania, which he bought out of bankruptcy, and real estate in New York and beyond. Catsimatidis unsuccessfully ran for mayor of New York City in 2013.
