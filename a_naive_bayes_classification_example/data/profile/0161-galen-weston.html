			Galen Weston is chairman emeritus of George Weston, the Canadian food and retail giant founded by his grandfather in 1882. After successfully running grocery and retail stores in Ireland, Galen was handed the reins to Loblaws, a struggling supermarket chain owned by his father, in 1972. He turned the company around by lopping off underperforming stores and redesigning the rest.  His son, Galen, Jr., oversees Loblaws today; it acquired Canadian drugstore chain Shoppers for about $12 billion in July 2013. The elder Weston also controls Selfridges Group, whose retail holdings include Holt Renfrew in Canada; Brown Thomas in Ireland; Selfridges in the United Kingdom; and de Bijenkorf in the Netherlands. He and his wife, Hilary, also created Windsor, a 416-acre luxury residential community in Vero Beach, FL.
