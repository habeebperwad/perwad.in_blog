			Comcast CEO Brian Roberts tried and failed to acquire Time Warner Cable, his next biggest competitor, for $45 billion in 2015. The combined company would have had even more national sway with content providers and local pricing power, but the deal couldn't get past regulators.   (Charter Communications ended up acquiring Time Warner Cable in May 2016.) Roberts has built Comcast on bold acquisitions, snapping up NBCUniversal from GE in 2013. Roberts' father Ralph cofounded Comcast in 1963 with the purchase of a 1,200-subscriber cable system in Tupelo, Mississippi, and took it public in 1972. The younger Roberts had his first Comcast internship at age 15, then made a rapid rise through the company, becoming president in 1990 at age 31 and inheriting the majority of his father's stock in 1999. A Philadelphia native, Roberts received his B.S. from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was also an All-American in squash.
