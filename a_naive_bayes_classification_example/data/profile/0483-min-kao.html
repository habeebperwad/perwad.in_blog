			Min Kao came to the U.S. from Taiwan in the 1970s and got a master's and a Ph.D. in engineering at the University of Tennessee. After leading development of the first GPS navigator at AlliedSignal, he joined Gary Burrell in 1989 to commercialize the technology.  The duo founded a GPS maker they dubbed Garmin, which is a play on their first names. By the end of 2016, the company had sold over 157 million products. As smartphones have eaten into sales of its standalone navigational units, Garmin has diversified into fitness wearables, bike computers and dog trackers. Kao stepped down as CEO in 2012 but remains executive chairman.
