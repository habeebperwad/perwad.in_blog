			Hans Melchers derives the lion's share of his fortune from a large stake in HAL Trust, an international investment company based in Monaco. Before that, in the late 80s, Melchers purchased a chemical manufacturing company.  Melchers retired as CEO in 2002 and the company was renamed Melspring. A passionate fan of bridge, the billionaire started his own professional team and provided major funding for the 2011 World Bridge Championship held in the Netherlands. He also collects modern and contemporary art, and in 2015 opened the MORE Museum in Gorssel, Netherlands to house over 1,000 of his pieces. Melchers purchased a small, 14th-century castle in the eastern Dutch city of Ruurlo, and hopes to open a second museum location there in 2017.
