			Yahoo cofounder David Filo stayed out of the spotlight as the embattled tech company negotiated a July 2016 deal to sell its core business to Verizon for $4.8 billion in cash. Filo started the company in 1994 with Jerry Yang, a classmate at his Stanford Ph.  D. program. The duo dropped out to run Yahoo the following year. Filo rejoined the board in 2014 after an 18-year hiatus and oversees technical operations as "Chief Yahoo" at the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company. Filo and his wife, Angela, helped launch the Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship in 2008 and have endowed professorships in engineering and education. In 2013, they helped create the K12 Start Fund, which invests in education technology companies. Their Yellow Chair Foundation, launched in 2000, gives grants to nonprofits working in education, civil rights and the environment.
