			In 1981 Michael Krasny, an out-of-work college graduate from University of Illinois with a passion for technology, placed a $3 ad in the Chicago Tribune to sell his IBM personal computer. The huge response the ad received transformed the then-28-year-old into an entrepreneur.  Krasny founded Computer Discount Warehouse in 1984 as an online store for IT products. The son of an auto dealer, he took the company public in 1993 and then retired from leadership in 2001. In 2007 the company was bought out by Madison Dearborn Partners for $7.3 billion and Krasny has maintained a low profile ever since. He is listed as president of Sawdust Investment Management Corp. He is an active donor to Jewish causes and medical research through his Circle of Service Foundation.
