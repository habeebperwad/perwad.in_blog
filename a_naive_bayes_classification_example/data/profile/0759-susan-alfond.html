			Susan Alfond is one of four heirs who are billionaires thanks to Warren Buffett's worst deal: the Dexter Shoe Company. Her father, Harold Alfond -- a onetime factory worker who never attended college -- bought an old mill in Dexter, Maine 1958 and turned it into a shoemaker that eventually sold millions of boots and causal shoes a year.  In 1993 Harold made a shrewd trade when he gave the company to Buffett in exchange for Berkshire Hathaway stock. The Alfonds have made billions from the rising value of those shares. Susan and her three brothers -- Ted, Bill and Peter -- also share a small stake in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool FC, plus stakes in Roush Fenway Racing and the New England Sports Network.
