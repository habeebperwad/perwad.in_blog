			Abdulla Al Ghurair and his billionaire brother, Saif, are scions of a prominent U.A.E. business family. In 1967 Abdulla founded Mashreqbank, now one of the country's leading banks. He is the bank's chairman and his son Abdul Aziz is CEO.  The family's eponymous holding company is run by an outsider with the help of Abdulla's sons, who oversee various divisions including food, construction, and real estate. In July 2015, Abdulla Al Ghurair pledged one third of his group's assets to a foundation that will invest in education programs in the U.A.E. and Arab countries, including scholarships.
