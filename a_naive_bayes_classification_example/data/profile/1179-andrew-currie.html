			Andrew Currie has been a director at chemicals giant Ineos since 1999, a year after the company was founded by majority owner and fellow billionaire James Ratcliffe. The Cambridge natural sciences grad started his career at BP Chemicals, spending 15 years in technical and managerial roles.  He later became a director at Inspec Group, the former parent company of Ineos. Headquartered in London, UK, Ineos produces everything from agro-chemicals and bio fuels to polymers and adhesives. It has been aggressively expanding into the shale gas industry; it supplies 1 in 10 UK homes with gas from its productions in the North Sea, and has access to over a million acres of exploration areas in England and Scotland. Currie derives most of his fortune from his minority stake in Ineos.
