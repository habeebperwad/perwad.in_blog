			A Haub family shop opened in 1867 in Muelheim an der Ruhr marked the beginning of Tengelmann Group. Its retail operations are now comprised of OBI DIY (home improvement); clothing and non-food discounter KiK; and dollar-store chain TEDi.  (In 2016, Tengelmann reached agreement to sell its struggling Kaiser's-Tengelmann supermarkets division for an undisclosed sum.) Since 2000, Karl-Erivan Haub, the oldest of the three sons of Erivan Haub, has been at the helm. Brother Christian serves as co-CEO of Tengelmann and chairman of Greenwich, Connecticut-based Emil Capital Partners, an umbrella for investment activities in North America. Another unit, Tengelmann E-Commerce, comprises various online retailing ventures as well as stakes in digital businesses including Zalando (the European equivalent of online shoe and clothing retailer Zappo's). The group also includes an energy services provider, a professional services outfit specializing in audits and consulting, and a property management and real estate development company. Erivan Haub has strong ties to Tacoma, Washington, where his sons were born. A civic booster and one of the city's largest real estate owners, he is credited with helping revitalize Union Station and is a major contributor to the University of Washington Tacoma, the Museum of Glass and the LeMay Automobile Museum. Other holdings include a buffalo ranch in Wyoming and 3,000 acres in Methow Valley, in the Cascade mountains of northern Washington, where he also owns a ski resort, Sun Valley Mountain Lodge.
