			After decades of investing his money with his two billionaires brothers, Dirk Ziff formed his own family office, Ziff Capital Partners, in 2015.The family office is reportedly leasing a floor at 285 Madison in New York City.  In 2014 the billionaire brothers Dirk, Daniel and Robert shuttered their hedge funds in the U.S. and London, though they're still using Ziff Brothers Investments to manage a portion of their money. The brothers are also reportedly investing some of their billions individually with investors who were formerly at their hedge funds but have since started their own shops. The roots of their fortune date back to 1927, when their grandfather William Sr. first started his publishing business. Their father William Jr. built up Ziff Davis, which became best known for such trade publications as PC Magazine and Car and Driver, before selling it for $1.4 billion in 1994. The brothers have since increased those proceeds by tenfold.
