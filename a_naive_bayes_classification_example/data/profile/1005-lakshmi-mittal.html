			Indian steel baron Lakshmi Mittal regains his status as the world's second richest Indian on an uptick in steel prices and demand. His ArcelorMittal, which had lost $7.9 billion in 2015, swung to a net profit of $1.8 billion in 2016, its first net profit since 2011. The world's biggest steelmaker also got a reprieve from import tariffs on steel imposed by the U. S. and Europe and a one-time $832 million saving from a new labor contract signed last year with its U.S. workers. The company, along with Italian steel firm Marcegaglia, has put in a bid to acquire Italy's loss making steel group Ilva, for an undisclosed price. Arcelor plans to build its new global headquarters in Luxembourg.
