			Tom Steyer spent 26 years running hedge fund Farallon Capital, then sold his stake in late 2012 and switched his focus to politics and the environment. The San Francisco resident spent about $90 million to back select Democratic candidates and climate change in the 2016 election cycle, only to see Donald Trump win as President and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.  He is still a passionate advocate of clean energy and has been one of the most vocal opponents of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline. Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, have donated tens of millions of dollars to alma maters Stanford and Yale for "advanced energy" research.
