			The Czech Republic's version of Donald Trump, Andrej Babis is a deputy prime minister and the minister of finance. He was forced to put his agrochemical firm, Agrofert, into a trust in early 2017 to comply with a new Czech conflict-of-interest law that is nicknamed "Lex Babis," or the Babis Law.  He swapped daily management of Agrofert for politics in 2013 and is now the leader of the political party ANO (which means "Yes"). The son of a businessman, he got his start as a fertilizer trader for Petrimex, the precursor to Agrofert. He also worked in Morocco where he gained experience with foreign trade. Babis owns the Michelin-starred restaurant La Paloma in the French Riviera.
