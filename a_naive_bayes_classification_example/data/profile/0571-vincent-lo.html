			The bulk of Vincent Lo's fortune stems from his listed Shui On Land, best known for developing Shanghai's entertainment district, Xintiandi. Lo also owns Shui On Centre, a landmark building in Wan Chai. His daughter Stephanie is heir apparent.  He's also no stranger to the temperament of fellow real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who in 2005 sued former partners Lo and Henry Cheng for $1 billion, claiming the two had not consulted him and closed on a deal for less than he would have. Trump lost but was granted proceeds from another deal with the partners.
