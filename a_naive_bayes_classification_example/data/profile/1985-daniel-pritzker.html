			Jazz buff Daniel Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt fortune, is at work on the production of Bolden!, a biographical drama about New Orleans trumpeter Buddy Bolden, which he began in 2007. His grandfather A. N. PritzÂ­ker (d. 1986) was a lawyer; with help from Daniel's father, Jay (d. 1999), and uncles, Robert (d. 2011) and Donald (d. 1972), the family built industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings and formed hotel chain Hyatt. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought the majority of Marmon Holdings for $4.8 billion in 2008 and later acquired the rest of the company. Daniel owns just over 5% of Hyatt.
