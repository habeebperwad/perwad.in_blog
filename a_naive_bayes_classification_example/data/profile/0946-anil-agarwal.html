			Metals magnate Anil Agarwal, who controls London-listed Vedanta Resources, saw his wealth rise on a metal revival that sent the company's shares surging in the past year. In a surprise move, he recently bought a 12% stake in London-listed miner Anglo American for $2.4 billion through his family holding firm, financing the purchase through bonds.  He also secured all approvals for the merger between Vedanta's debt-laden Indian unit and cash-rich oil-and-gas firm Cairn India after sweetening the terms for minority investors. Agarwal's longstanding plan to acquire from the government the remaining 30% stake in Hindustan Zinc that he doesn't own has still to see the light of day. His listed Sterlite Technologies has hived off its power transmission business into a separate company with a view to listing an infrastructure investment trust.
