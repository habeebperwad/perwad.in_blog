			One of the largest apartment owners on the West Coast, Sanford Diller made a fortune on the housing boom in the San Francisco Bay Area. His Prometheus Real Estate Group, in which he has a two-thirds stake, owns more than 15,000 units in the Bay Area, Seattle and Portland.  The company, founded in 1965, also owns retail and office properties, and counts fellow billionaire John A. Sobrato's development firm as an investor. Diller's daughter, Jackie Safier, is president of and runs the firm's operations. In January 2017, the Diller family pledged a record $500 million to the University of California, San Francisco, to help it attract faculty and students and fund innovative projects. The gift comes from the Helen Diller Family Foundation, founded by Sanford's wife, a prominent philanthropist who died in January 2015. The foundation had previously donated $35 million to UCSF for cancer research.
