			In 2005, Andreas Struengmann and his twin brother, Thomas, who together founded generic drug maker Hexal AG in 1986, sold the business (along with their 68% stake in U.S.-based Eon Labs) to Novartis for $7.5 billion.  Since then, they've been actively investing in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Their holdings also include a private bank, Stuttgart-based Sudwestbank. In 2008, they established a neuroscience research center in Frankfurt named after their father, Ernst Struengmann. After studying medicine in Freiburg, Germany, Andreas worked as a doctor in South Africa. He is known to love sailing, golf and skiing.
