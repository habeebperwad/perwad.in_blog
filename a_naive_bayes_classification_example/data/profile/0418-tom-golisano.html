			Tom Golisano founded payroll firm Paychex in 1971 with just $3,000 and a credit card. He remains chairman of the publicly-traded company, which brought in nearly $3 billion in revenue in 2016. The longtime New Yorker (who now lives in Florida) sold the NHL's Buffalo Sabres to fellow billionaire Terry Pegula in March 2011 for $189 million, rejecting a rival bid that would have netted him an additional $70 million because it would have involved moving the team from Buffalo.  Golisano, who was born in Rochester, New York to a macaroni salesman and a seamstress, ran for governor three times under the Independence Party of New York. He is married to tennis hall-of-famer Monica Seles.
