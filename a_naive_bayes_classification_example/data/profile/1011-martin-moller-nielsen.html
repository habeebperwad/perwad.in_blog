			Danish aviation entrepreneur Martin MÃ¸ller Nielsen founded aircraft leasing firm Nordic Aviation Capital in 1990; a quarter of a century later, he sold a 50% stake in it to private equity firm EQT in a transaction that valued the firm at $3.3 billion net of debt.  He still owns 50% of NAC, which initially leased aircraft for humanitarian aid organizations looking to fly into remote areas. It now caters largely to regional commercial airlines operating in 30 countries. The group, which started in Skive, Denmark, now has offices in Denmark, Ireland, North America and Singapore. It has a fleet of 350 airplanes and customers include Air Berlin, Olympic Air, and Etihad Regional.
