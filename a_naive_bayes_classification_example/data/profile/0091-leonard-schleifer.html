			Leonard Schleifer cofounded drugmaker Regeneron in 1988. He remains CEO of the  Tarrytown, New York company, which has been looking for a follow-up to Eylea, a treatment for macular degeneration with more than $5 billion in sales.  Their big hope, cholesterol drug Praluent, has had disappointing sales and faces a patent infringement case from rival Amgen. Regeneron is now betting on a treatment for atopic dermatitis to be a big hit. Schleifer, who has most of his fortune tied up in Regeneron, grew up in Queens. He was the son of a sweater manufacturer who attended Cornell on scholarship and dreamed of a medical career but had to return to the family business. Schleifer followed his father's footsteps to Cornell and then got an M.D.-PhD degree at the University of Virginia, training with future Nobel Laureate Alfred Gilman.  Regeneron now sponsors the Science Talent Search competition for high school students. It was previously run by Westinghouse, then, more recently, Intel. Schleifer competed as a teenager.
