			Coal, energy and real estate investor Pavel Tykac began as a computer distributor in the early 1990s, plowing profits into a small regional bank. He later partnered with four colleagues to found Motoinvest, which specialized in hostile takeovers during the Czech Republic's privatization program.  Known as "Motorky" (or "Boys"), they bought and later sold banking stakes. His largest assets now are two Czech coal mining firms that he owns through Cyprus-based Indoverse Czech Coal Investments. Tykac is an avid runner and badminton player.
