			Fracking billionaire Dan Wilks has come a long way since his humble beginnings in small-town Texas. In 2011 he and his brother, fellow-billionaire Farris Wilks, sold their hydraulic fracturing and oilfield services company to the government of Singapore for $3.5 billion.  Since then, they have been on a land-buying frenzy: scooping up more than 500,000 acres of real estate across five states. The Wilks brothers began their careers as stone masons, following in the footsteps of their father, who had started in the industry with the hopes of building his family its first real home. Years later the brothers founded Wilks Masonry before establishing Frac Tech, the oil and natural gas giant that earned the siblings their fortune. Today Dan Wilks continues to reside in Cisco, Texas. His brother lives nearby.
