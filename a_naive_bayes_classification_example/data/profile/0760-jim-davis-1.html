			Jim Davis is cofounder and chairman of Allegis Group, the world's largest privately held staffing company. Davis started the firm with his cousin, fellow billionaire Stephen Bisciotti, as Aerotek in 1983, with a focus on matching skilled workers to technical positions at industrial, engineering, and aeronautical companies.  Following years of expansion, Aerotek rebranded as Allegis Group in 1998. Today the firm has 120,000 contracted workers and offices on four different continents. Recently, Davis has used income from his businesses to launch a private investment firm with Bisciotti, Redwood Capital, and has bankrolled an additional $500 million-plus to his family's foundation since its inception in 2002. In 2013, he endowed his alma mater, Villanova University, with $50 million, the single biggest donation in the college's history. Davis is also a minority owner of the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals.
