			Amos Hostetter Jr. made a fortune in the 1990s as cable TV pioneer and now is most active in philanthropy. His family's Barr Foundation donates tens of millions of dollars each year to support the arts and education and fight climate change; it has assets of $1.6 billion.  Hostetter also runs Pilot House Ventures, an early-stage investment firm. He set out with an MBA and $1,500 in the 1960s to invest in a cable TV company that eventually became Continental Cablevision, once the third largest cable TV company in the country. He sold it to US West for $11 billion in 1996. Four years later, he helped AT&T buy back the business, then called MediaOne, for $44 billion and got a board seat. Hostetter owns seaside property on Nantucket, and one of the island's best French restaurants, The Chanticleer.
