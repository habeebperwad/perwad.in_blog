			Billionaire brothers Randall and Gary Rollins preside over the biggest pest control company by revenues in North America. Of the 14 subsidiaries under the Rollins Inc. umbrella, exterminator Orkin is the best known.  The bug-killing business is booming. Since 2010, Randall and Gary Rollins' heirs have been suing the brothers, alleging that the older generation has been blocking access to a complex web of trusts and holding companies worth in the region of $3 billion. In July 2016, a Georgia court ruled that the case should go to trial.
