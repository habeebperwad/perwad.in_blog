			Ricardo Salinas Pliego runs two large Mexican companies: the number two TV broadcaster, TV Azteca, and retailer Grupo Elektra. Both are publicly traded. In an attempt to give TV Azteca a jolt, in October 2015 he named his son, Benjamin Salinas Sada, 32, the CEO.  The largest part of his fortune still lies in appliance retailer and banking company Grupo Elektra, which targets less prosperous consumers who borrow money from his banking arm, Banco Azteca, to buy items like TVs and refrigerators at his Elektra stores. Elektra was founded in the 1950's by Ricardo's grandfather, Hugo Salinas Rocha.
