			Stephen Rubin presides over Pentland Group, one of the U.K.'s largest sports apparel companies. It own brands like Speedo and Berghaus and has a majority stake in publicly-traded retailer JD Sports Fashion.  Pentland is also the global licensee for Lacoste and Ted Baker footwear, and the company owns around 25% of Hunter boots. Rubin's parents founded Pentland in 1932 as a shoe wholesaler. He joined the firm in 1959 and took over as chairman after his father's death in 1969, five years after it went public. The company paid $77,500 for a 55% stake in Reebok USA in 1981. The following year Reebok rode the aerobics craze, launching the first shoe designed for that activity. In 1984 Pentland expanded its Reebok holdings when it bought a 55% stake in its international business too. In 1991 it sold off its Reebok investments for $770 million. Stephen is chairman of Pentland, while his son, Andy, runs its brand division.
