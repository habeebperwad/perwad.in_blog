			Thomas Schmidheiny's ancestors built an empire making bricks and cement; when Thomas' father Max divided the estate in 1984 Thomas inherited cement and concrete supplier Holcim while his brother Stephan, also a billionaire, got construction company Eternit.  Thomas retired from his role as chairman of Holcim in 2003 after running the company for twenty years. In July 2015, Holcim completed its mega-merger with France's Lafarge, creating the largest cement manufacturer in the world; Schmidheiny now holds just under 12% of the company. He also owns vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley, Australia, Argentina, and Switzerland.
