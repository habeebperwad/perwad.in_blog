			A. Jerrold "Jerry" Perenchio, the former chairman of Spanish-language broadcast network Univision, is the the grandson of Italian immigrants. He founded a Hollywood talent agency in 1964, representing the likes of Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor and producing such shows as The Jeffersons and Diff'rent Strokes.  He later formed Embassy Communications with All in the Family producer Norman Lear, then sold it to Coca-Cola for $485 million in 1985. Back in 1992 he bought Univision with two Latin American broadcasting partners for just $550 million. When a group of investors led by fellow Los Angeles billionaire Haim Saban acquired Univision in 2007 for $13.7 billion, FORBES estimated that Perenchio netted $1.1 billion. Now retired, he owns residential and commercial properties in Southern California, mostly in Malibu. After bequeathing an art collection worth an estimated $500 million to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in November 2014, Perenchio pledged $25 million in April 2016 towards a new modernist building to house the works.
