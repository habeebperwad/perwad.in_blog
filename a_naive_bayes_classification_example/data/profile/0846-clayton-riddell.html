			Canadian oil baron Clayton Riddell has built an empire over the past four decades, starting with near-barren natural gas wells when he founded Paramount Resources in 1974. Paramount, where he is executive chairman, remains his largest holding.  He was CEO of the firm until May 2015, when he passed the reins to his son, Jim. Riddell is a shareholder of several other publicly traded Canadian energy companies, some of which he has spun out from Paramount, and owns a stake in the NHL's Calgary Flames.
