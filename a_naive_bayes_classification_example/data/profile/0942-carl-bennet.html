			Swedish industrialist Carl Bennet controls three companies on the Stockholm stock exchange, including business group Lifco and printing company Elanders. His most valuable asset is medical products company Getinge, which Bennet and fellow investor Rune Andersson acquired from Electrolux in 1989. They ran the company together for nearly a decade before parting ways.  Bennet has criticized Sweden's central-left government for not doing enough to decrease youth unemployment in Sweden, which he describes as an "ulcer on society"; he proposes a German-style apprentice system.
