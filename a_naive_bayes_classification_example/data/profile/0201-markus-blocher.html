			Markus Blocher joins the billionaires list in 2017 following a sharp increase in the share price of chemical maker Dottikon ES Holding, a maker of ingredients for pharmaceuticals and a variety of chemicals for use in cosmetics, food additives and agriculture.  Blocher got his start working at EMS-Chemie, a Swiss polymer and chemical manufacturer formerly owned by his father, Christoph Blocher. In 2003 Christof distributed his 60% stake in EMS-Chemie to Markus and his three sisters. Markus sold his shares to his sisters and took over Dottikon ES, which was spun out of EMS-Chemie. Markus Blocher is the CEO of Dottikon ES, which is listed in Switzerland and describes itself as a strategic development and manufacturing partner to leading chemical and pharmaceutical companies across the globe.
