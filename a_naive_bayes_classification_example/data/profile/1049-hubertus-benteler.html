			Benteler International's roots date back to 1876 when Carl Benteler opened an ironware shop in Bielefeld, Germany. Son Eduard took over 40 years later, purchased an engineering works and expanded into the manufacture of seamless and welded tubes for products such as masts and lamp posts.  Its first automotive order came in 1935: exhaust pipes for the Ford Eifel. Hubertus' father Erich inherited the company in 1942 and together with his brother Helmut turned Benteler International into a global engineering giant, with revenue of around $8 billion. In addition to making automotive chassis and modules as well as systems and components for powertrain and exhaust applications, Benteler provides mechanical engineering services to industrial customers and produces flat-glass processing equipment for the architectural, automotive, solar and display glass industries, plus steel tube products. Hubertus Benteler, who serves as chairman, owns 50% of the company, while his uncle Helmut's descendants own the other half. Benteler plans to retire in 2017. He lives in a gigantic castle in Salzburg, Austria.
