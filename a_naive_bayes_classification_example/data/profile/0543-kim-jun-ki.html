			Kim Jun-Ki chairs Dongbu Group, which holds interests in steel, chemicals, finance, electronics and real estate development. Son of a former deputy speaker in the South Korean parliament, he took a 40-day overseas trip in 1969 and was so inspired by what he saw in Japan and the U. S. that he decided to start a construction company rather than pursue his studies. The business took off in the 1970s, riding the Middle East construction boom. His net-worth figure includes the shares of his only son, Kim Nam-Ho, who is vice president and owns a bigger stake than his dad as part of succession planning.
