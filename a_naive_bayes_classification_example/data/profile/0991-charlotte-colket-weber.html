			Charlotte Colket Weber is a Campbell Soup Company heir. She served on the business' board from 1990 until November 2014, when she stepped down due to age limits. Her billionaire cousins, Bennett Dorrance and Mary Alice Dorrance Malone, are still directors.  Their grandfather, John T. Dorrance, invented the condensed soup formula that turned the company into a global soup empire. Weber is a devoted equestrian lover and owns the Live Oak Stud Farm, a 4,500-acre horse farm and commercial cattle operation just west of Ocala, Florida. She has also been an avid collector of Chinese art, a passion that reportedly began when her uncle gave her a rare porcelain K'ang-hsi frog in the 1970s. In 1988 she donated a collection worth $20 million to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she's an honorary trustee.
