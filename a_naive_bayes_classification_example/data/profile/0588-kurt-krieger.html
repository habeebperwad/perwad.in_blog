Since then he has turned it into one of Germany's largest furniture retailers, trailing Swedish giant IKEA and Lutz Group.  Success kicked in after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 when Krieger used the opportunity to tap into new markets in eastern Germany. Besides Hoeffner Group, Krieger owns real estate in his hometown Berlin, having acquired almost 100 acres in 2010. He's planning a development project with schools, shopping centers and, of course, a furniture store in the northern part of the city. In his youth, Krieger wanted to become a musician. He still plays the piano and flies his own helicopter.
