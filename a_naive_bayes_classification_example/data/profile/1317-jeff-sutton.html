			King of Manhattan storefronts, Jeff Sutton commands some of the highest rents in the country with pricey leases to such brands as Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Escada. In late 2016, he and frequent partner SL Green signed Nike to a new lease at 650 Fifth Avenue worth $700 million over 15 years, which Sutton says is a new world retail rent record.  One of his first big deals was leasing the American Girl store at 609 Fifth Avenue in 2002; that retailer is relocating in the fall of 2017.  In 2015, he and a partner paid $1.78 billion for the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue. A graduate of Wharton, Sutton got his start as a retail broker. First deal: he drove a Payless ShoeSource executive around the city and asked him to point to a property he wanted. He got the client to sign a lease, even though the space wasn't available, then convinced the building's owner to sell him the property. The grandson of Syrian Jews, he still lives in the tight knit neighborhood of Gravesend, Brooklyn, where his family settled. He became a grandfather himself for the first time recently.
