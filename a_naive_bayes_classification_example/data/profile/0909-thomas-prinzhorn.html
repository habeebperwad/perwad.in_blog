			Wastepaper king Thomas Prinzhorn owns Austria's largest containerboard company, Prinzhorn Holding, though these days he devotes his time to politics as a member of the national liberal party alliance for the Future of Austria.  Prinzhorn studied engineering at the Technical University of Vienna, then went to Harvard for his MBA. After graduation, he started working at his father's small paper packaging company, turning it into a paper and containerboard behemoth, with revenues of $1.3 billion. His son, Cord Prinzhorn, handles management of the company.
