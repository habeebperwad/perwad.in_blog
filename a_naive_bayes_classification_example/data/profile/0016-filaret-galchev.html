			Filaret Galchev got his start in coal, but made the bulk of his fortune in cement, buying plants from Stern Cement and from Inteko, the construction company owned by Russia's richest woman, Elena Baturina.  His Eurocement Group is now Russia's largest cement producer. In February 2016, Galchev lost his 6.2% stake in the world's largest cement producer, LafargeHolcim, as a result of margin call. Also in 2016, his Eurocement agreed to restructure its loans with Russia's largest bank, Sberbank.
