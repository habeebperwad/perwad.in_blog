			Iceland's sole billionaire Thor Bjorgolfsson made his first fortune in the wilds of Russia, cofounding Bravo brewery and creating the popular Botchkarov beer brand. He sold to Heineken in 2002 and used the proceeds to go on a buying spree in his native Iceland and Eastern Europe.  He lost nearly all of his fortune during the financial crisis when Iceland nearly went bankrupt and he suddenly had to find a way to pay off more than $1 billion in debts. At the time he was vilified; his Reykjavik home crudely graffitied with his image and "2008" -- the year of his "death." "Everyone f'-ed up including me," he said. Bjorgolfsson, whose great grandfather faced bankruptcy twice and whose father filed for bankruptcy in 2009, was determined to avoid the same fate. He and his creditors worked out a complex agreement that allowed him time to pay off his debts while holding onto key stakes in several businesses including Polish telecom outfit Play, today his most valuable investment. He has since recovered and remains a prolific investor with stakes in Chilean telecom firm WOM (formerly known as Nextel) and in U.S. startups like Zwift, an online platform for indoor cyclists.
