			Bertil Hult dropped out of college after just a year to start a business in his dormitory's basement, organizing summer trips to help Swedish students learn English in the UK during their holiday break. Today his company, EF Education First, run by his three oldest sons, offers cultural exchanges, educational travel, language training and degree programs in 53 countries.  It is the official supplier of language training for the Olympic games; for the 2016 games in Rio De Janeiro, EF says it helped teach English to 1 million Brazilians. A dyslexic, he donates money to a Swedish school that focuses on innovative approaches to educating children with the learning disability. He is friendly with the Swedish royal family and together with the Queen he founded the Mentor Foundation, which works to prevent substance abuse. He is also the benefactor of the Hult Prize, a partnership with former President Bill Clinton that awards $1 million in seed funding to the winners of a student competition focused on launching a social business that solves specific challenges like food security, water quality and access, and early childhood education in the urban slums.
