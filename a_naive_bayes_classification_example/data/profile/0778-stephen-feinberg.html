			During his 20-plus-year stint at Cerberus Capital Management, private equity investor Stephen Feinberg has generated some excellent returns -- and some abysmal PR. In 2013, the company attracted attention for its stake in Freedom Group, which manufactured the Bushmaster rifle used in the Sandy Hook massacre.  In 2009, Cerberus suffered the bankruptcy of Chrysler Group, which it had bought two years earlier. Feinberg's more recent moves have not been so fraught: Cerberus, which employs former Treasury Secretary John Snow and former Vice President Dan Quayle, oversaw the successful merger of supermarkets Safeway and Albertsons in 2015. In February 2017, it was reported that Feinberg was in talks with the Trump administration to review US intelligence agencies.
