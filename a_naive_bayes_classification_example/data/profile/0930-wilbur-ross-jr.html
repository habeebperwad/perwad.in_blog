			Distressed asset investor Wilbur Ross has a new job title: U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Ross, who served as an economic policy adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, has known the real estate magnate for more than two decades.  Ross spent 25 years heading Rothschild Inc.'s bankruptcy practice before starting investment firm WL Ross & Co. in 2000. He sold it in 2006 to investment management firm Invesco for about $375 million. In August 2016 WL Ross & Co. agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine to the SEC related to charges that it didn't properly disclose how transaction fees would be allocated. The firm did not admit to any wrongdoing. An avid art collector, Ross has some 40 works by Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte as well as contemporary pieces by Chinese and Vietnamese artists.
