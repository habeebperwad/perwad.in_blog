			A so-called Tiger Cub who worked for famed hedge fund manager Julian Robertson, Citrone founded Discovery Capital Management in 1999. His hedge funds tend to make macro bets and invest in emerging markets.  In 2016, after losing money for two straight years, his Discovery Global Macro Fund produced a 9% gain, reportedly from stock bets made in the last two months of the year. Citrone was a wrestler in high school and today owns a small slice of his favorite football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.
