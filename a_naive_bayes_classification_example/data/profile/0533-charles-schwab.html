			Charles "Chuck" Schwab stepped down as CEO of his eponymous brokerage firm in 2008, though he remains executive chairman and largest shareholder with an 11% stake. He founded the discount brokerage firm in 1971 as a traditional brick-and-mortar brokerage; it now has $2.61 trillion in assets.  Bolstered by federal deregulation of brokerage commissions, he started charging half what full-service brokers were by cutting all but the basics. The decision, along with his firm's early lead in online trading, turned Charles Schwab Corp. into the largest discount securities dealer in the U.S. today. A dyslexic and the parent of one, Schwab works to assist children with the disorder through the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation.
