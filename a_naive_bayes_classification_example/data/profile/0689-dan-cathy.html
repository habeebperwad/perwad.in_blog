			Dan Cathy owes his fortune to fried chicken. He is the chairman and CEO of Chick-fil-A, the $6.8 billion (est. 2015 sales) fast-food juggernaut known for its deeply religious beliefs and for closing its 2,000 stores on Sundays.  In 2012, the same year he became CEO, Dan made anti-same sex marriage remarks that sparked nationwide protests. He later apologized for dragging the company into controversy and has since tried to shy away from making political comments. Following a shooting at an Orlando club in June 2016, a number of locations opened on a Sunday to feed first responders and blood donors. Dan's father, Truett Cathy, got his start serving chicken sandwiches to factory and airport workers, and opened his first Chick-fil-A in an Atlanta mall in 1967. Truett died in September 2014 at age 93; Dan's mother, Jeannette, died less than a year later in July 2015. His brother, Bubba Cathy, is senior vice president of the company. Dan plays the trumpet, and is an avid motorcyclist and licensed pilot. He also teaches Sunday school.
