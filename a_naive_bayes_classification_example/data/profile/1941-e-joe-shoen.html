			Son of U-Haul founder Leonard Samuel (L.S.) Shoen, Joe grabbed control of the business in 1986, alienating his father and most of his 12 siblings. Decades later he is still firmly in control of U-Haul. He is the president and chairman of U-Haul's $3.3 billion (sales) parent company, Amerco.   Despite his problems working with his own dad, Joe's sons Stuart and Sam are both executives.
