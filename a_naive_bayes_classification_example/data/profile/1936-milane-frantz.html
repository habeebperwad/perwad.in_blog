			Milane Duncan Frantz's father Dan Duncan founded Houston-based pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners. Frantz and her three siblings all inherited a stake in the company after he died in 2010. Enterprise Products Partners, which is publicly traded, owns nearly 49,000 miles of pipelines and the largest oil storage facility on the Gulf Coast.  Sister Randa Duncan Williams, the non-executive chairman of the board, is the only sibling involved in the business. Frantz, meanwhile, is a board member of Houston's Hermann Park Conservancy.
