			Katharine Rayner and her siblings, James Cox Chambers and Margaretta Taylor, are heirs to the Cox family fortune. Their grandfather, James M. Cox, founded what has become Cox Enterprises, an automotive and media conglomerate.  The three siblings split the 50% stake they inherited from their mother, Anne Cox Chambers, 96, in an asset shuffling that became public in 2015. Anne never had an active role at Cox Enterprises, and neither have her children. The firm remains entirely owned by the family, and Katharine's cousin, Jim Kennedy, is its chairman. Like her sister Margaretta, Katherine focuses on philanthropy. She sits on the board of the Morgan Library, the New York Public Library and the Animal Rescue Fund.
