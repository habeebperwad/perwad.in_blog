			In 2016 Zarakh Iliev and his partner, billionaire God Nisanov, bought land in the center of Moscow, not far from the Kremlin, where they plan to build hotels. The partners own nearly 14 million of square feet of real estate in Moscow including a 225-acre wholesale distribution center, Food City, that they developed to look like such cities as Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Mexico City.   They also own several shopping centers on Moscow's outskirts. Their minority business partner, Ilkham Ragimov, graduated from Leningrad State University in the same class as President Vladimir Putin. They opened Moscow's Moskvarium, said to be Europe's biggest aquarium, with 8,000 sea creatures and seven pools where visitors can swim with dolphins, in 2015. Iliev and Nisanov were born in the same village Krasnaya Sloboda in Azerbaijan's mountains. They started business together in early 90s and share all their assets equally and split everything down the middle. Due to an error, Iliev was listed at $3 billion when he should have been listed at $3.1 billion, same as Nisanov.
