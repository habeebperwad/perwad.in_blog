			Guido Barilla is a fourth-generation heir to the Barilla pasta fortune, which he shares with his three billionaire siblings. Barilla is the largest pasta company in the world with an estimated $3.7 billion in annual revenue.  Guido, the CEO, stirred controversy in 2013 when he said Barilla wouldn't show LGBT families in advertising and didn't envision LGBT families as consumers of its pasta. A boycott ensued and the company has made changes since then, including rolling out anti-discrimination policies, hiring a high-profile chief diversity officer and earning a top "LGBT-friendly" grade from the Human Rights Campaign in 2014. Founded in 1877 in Parma, Italy, Barilla had three generations of family leaders before selling to American firm W.R. Grace in 1971. Eight years later, Pietro Barilla, Guido's father, bought the company back. Pietro's four children now split ownership of the company equally.
