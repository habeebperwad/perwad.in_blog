			Ian Wood transformed a family owned fishing business based in Aberdeen, Scotland into Wood Group, a multinational oil services company with operations in over 50 countries and 42,000 employees. He joined the family business in 1962, became CEO in 1967 and ran the firm for nearly five decades--taking it public in 2002--then served as chairman before retiring in 2012. Wood and his family have sold much of their stake in the company over the years, diversifying into other investments.  Wood, knighted in 1994 and awarded a Knight Grand Cross in 2016, has put more than $200 million into the philanthropic Wood Family Trust. As the oil industry took a downturn, Wood set up Opportunity North East, an economic development agency that aims to revitalize and diversify Aberdeen's oil-dependent economy.
