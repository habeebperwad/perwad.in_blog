			Dorrance "Dodo" Hamilton is among the grandchildren of John Dorrance, a chemical engineer who invented the Campbell Soup Company's condensed soup formula. The global food giant had sales of $8 billion in 2015. Besides the iconic soup, it owns Prego, V8, Pepperidge Farm and other major food and beverage brands.  Over the years, Hamilton has been involved in a number of philanthropic endeavors. One of those, her SVF Foundation, preserves genetic material from rare food and fiber breeds with the goal of protecting the world's food supply. A floral display aficionado, she's won more than 2,000 blue ribbons from three decades of competing in the Philadelphia Flower Show.
