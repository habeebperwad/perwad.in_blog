			In September 2016 H. Ross Perot Jr.'s Hillwood Development announced a deal to sell 15 million square feet of warehouses across the U.S. to Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties for $1.1 billion. It's a nice liquidity event for Perot, who has plenty of other projects into which he can redeploy the capital.  Like the 200,000 square foot family office under construction on tony Turtle Creek in Dallas. Nearby he's also working on a 350,000 sq. ft. office tower. Perot wants to put a lasting mark on Dallas, and is even commissioning designs for a massive skyscraper for downtown. Growing up, Perot watched his famous father build Electronic Data Services into an I.T. juggernaut. And it inspired him. After the Air Force (and completing the first ever circumnavigation of the world by helicopter), Perot Jr. started acquiring land north of Fort Worth, Tex. Eventually he cobbled together 18,000 acres there and built AllianceTexas, a pioneering "inland port" featuring an industrial airport, a giant rail yard, access to the Interstate and 37 million square feet of warehouses. To Perot's good fortune, drillers soon discovered the giant Barnett Shale natural gas field under his land. He's since sold off most of the gas reserves for about $1 billion and grossed billions more developing real estate. For fun: with Google guys Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Perot backs space startup Planetary Resources seeking to mine asteroids for precious metals.
