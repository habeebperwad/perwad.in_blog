			Arthur Blank and fellow billionaire Bernie Marcus cofounded Home Depot in 1978 after being fired from their jobs at a regional hardware store. Home Depot has grown to be one of the world's largest home improvement retailers, with over 2,200 stores across the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Blank stepped back from Home Depot management in 2001 and made a name for himself in the world of professional sports. In 2002, he paid $545 million for the Atlanta Falcons, a team now worth $2.1 billion. The team made it to Super Bowl LI in 2017 but lost to fellow billionaire Robert Kraft's New England Patriots. He paid a $70 million expansion fee to bring the next Major League Soccer team to Atlanta, Atlanta United FC, which kicked off its inaugural season in March 2017. Both of Blank's teams will play in a new $1.5 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta scheduled to open in July 2017.
