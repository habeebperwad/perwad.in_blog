			The brands associated with Stefan Reimann's multi-billion-dollar fortune include Calvin Klein fragrances, Durex condoms, Jimmy Choo shoes, Peet's Coffee, Krispy Kreme donuts and Noah's bagels. He is a descendant of chemist Ludwig Reimann, who, in 1828, joined with Johann Adam Benckiser.  Five years earlier, Benckiser had founded a namesake chemical company. Reimann married one of his daughters and wound up owning the business. Great-grandson Albert Reimann Jr. took the reins after his father died in 1952, and added consumer goods. Upon Albert's death in 1984, Wolfgang and eight other heirs each inherited 11.1% of JAB Holding Company s.à.r.l (JAB). Five of them subsequently divested their stakes, leaving Wolfgang and three of his siblings sharing a 95% interest in the Luxembourg-based investment company. Its holdings include 80% of Coty Inc., a maker of beauty products and perfumes best known for celebrity and fashion collaborations, and 8.9% of Reckitt Benckiser, a multinational (health, hygiene and home products) formed via the 1999 merger of the Reimann family business with Britain's Reckitt & Colman Ltd. More recently, JAB has acquired controlling stakes in such luxury brands as Jimmy Choo, Bally and Belstaff.  Since 2012, it has entered into deals worth $25 billion in a bid to become the world's leading pure-play coffee company. In December 2015, JAB reached a $13.9 billion agreement with Keurig Green Mountain to take over the publicly traded coffee business. This came only months after European anti-trust regulators blessed JAB's Amsterdam-based D.E Master Blenders' $5-billion combination with Mondelēz International's coffee business to form Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Previous successful targets of JAB's buying spree had included Peet's Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee Co. and the Einstein Noah Restaurant Group. In May, 2016, JAB took donut chain Krispy Kreme private in a $1.35 billion deal.
Neither Stefan nor any of his siblings are active in the management of JAB or the operations of its portfolio companies.
