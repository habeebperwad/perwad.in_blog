			Real estate mogul George Argyros runs Arnel & Affiliates, which owns 5,500 apartments in Orange County, Calif. and nearly 2 million square feet of commercial real estate in southern California. Until recently, he was also a board member of DST Systems, First American Financial Corp.  and Pacific Mercantile bank; he remains a shareholder in these and a handful of other companies. Argyros was once the largest stockholder in DST Systems, a Kansas software developer, but has sold the bulk of his and his family's shares under a 2014 agreement. The grandson of Greek immigrants, Argyros worked his way through high school and Chapman University in southern California as a paperboy and supermarket clerk. He founded Arnel in 1968 and owned the Seattle Mariners baseball team during the 1980s. From 2001 to 2004, he was the U.S. Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. In August 2015, Argyros and his wife, Julia, pledged $13.5 million to help renovate an Orange County cultural center.
