			Dietmar Hopp left IBM with four colleagues in 1972 to launch German software company SAP.  The company went public in 1988. He served as co-CEO from 1988 to 1998 and then as chairman of the supervisory board until 2003. He retired from the SAP board in 2005. SAP has over 80,000 employees worldwide and generates annual revenue in excess of $23 billion.  In 2006, Hopp transferred nearly three-quarters of his SAP stake (he owned 10% of the company) into a limited-liability company with a charitable purpose; his Dietmar Hopp Stiftung supports sports, medicine, education and social programs and has distributed over $470 million since its start. Forbes counts the SAP shares in the Dietmar Hopp Stiftung towards Hopp's net worth because he controls them and can sell them at any time (though the dividends must be used for a charitable purpose to avoid tax liability). Through his holding company Dievini, he invests in life sciences and biotech companies including Switzerland's AC Immune, which is developing a drug for Alzheimer's. The Hopp family owns Domaine de Terre Blanche, a luxury golf resort and gated community in Provence, France, purchased from the actor Sean Connery. Dietmar Hopp is the main financial backer of TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, a soccer club that plays in the First Bundesliga, the top division of Germany's league system.
