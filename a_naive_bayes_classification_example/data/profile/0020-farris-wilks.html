			Farris Wilks and his billionaire brother, Dan, sold their hydraulic fracturing and oilfield services company to the Singaporean government for $3.5 billion in 2011. Since then, they have not slowed down -- buying more than 500,000 acres of land across five different states.  The Wilks brothers began their careers as stone masons, their father's occupation, before starting Wilks Masonry in 1995. Five years later they founded Frac Tech, the oil and natural gas powerhouse that would earn the duo their fortunes. Today Farris Wilks keeps busy as a major political donor, the father of 11 children and the pastor of his own church in Cisco, Texas. His brother continues to live nearby.
