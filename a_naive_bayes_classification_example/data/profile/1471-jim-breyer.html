			Early Facebook investor Jim Breyer is actively investing through his own Breyer Capital after a 28-year run at venture firm Accel Partners. His firm has teamed up with China's IDG Capital Partners to raise a $1 billion venture fund.  Breyer also has stakes in Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi, digital currency firm Circle, secure communication app Wickr and build-and code-your own computer maker Kano. Over the years, he's been an investor in more than 30 companies that have completed successful public offerings or mergers. Breyer sits on the boards of Blackstone Group and 20th Century Fox. He is a minority owner of the NBA's Boston Celtics. His parents fled Hungary in 1956, and he spent his first few years living in a funeral home in New Haven, the cheapest place his family could afford. (His dad had a scholarship to Yale) In 1982, Breyer sent his resume and letter to Steve Jobs, who forwarded it to Apple's director of marketing, who hired him for the summer and part-time while he was an undergrad at Stanford University.
