			Dhanin Chearavanont, head of Thailand's agribusiness conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, got a boost to his wealth partly due to new information on his private holdings. The tycoon expanded CP's footprint into the U. S. food market in November with the $1.1 billion acquisition of Bellisio Foods, one of America's largest frozen food companies. Dhanin is the son of Chia Ek Chor, who along with his brother Choncharoen Chiaravanont, got a start in 1921 with a shop supplying seeds imported from China to Thai farmers. Dhanin's son Suphachai runs telecom arm True.
