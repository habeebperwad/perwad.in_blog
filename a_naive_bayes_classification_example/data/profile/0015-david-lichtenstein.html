			Son of Brooklyn public school teachers, David Lichtenstein never went to college and figured his best bet at making money was in real estate. In 1986, he used hefty amounts of credit card debt to spend $89,000 on his first two-family home in New Jersey.  As cash from rentals rolled in, his Lightstone Group started expanding, first to outlet malls and then to middle-income hotel investments. In 2007 he paid $7.4 billion in debt and $200 million in equity for Extended Stay America, a chain of mid-priced hotels. When the global credit crisis hit, Extended Stay was forced into bankruptcy protection, and was taken over by a team of investors including Blackstone Group and Paulson and Co. Lightstone later sold 20 outlets for $2.3 billion. Lichtenstein's real estate company has now bounced back. It is moving fast again into hotels, this time looking to take a bite out of AirBnB's market share by developing hip city hotels with Marriott featuring micro-units to attract millennials on a budget. His current portfolio still includes apartments, retail and commercial properties spread across 26 states and D.C. with $2 billion worth of projects in development. During the real estate crisis of the mid-aughts he also bought up tens of thousands of land lots in the "ground-zeros" of the crisis (Florida, Arizona, California, Nevada) for cheap.
