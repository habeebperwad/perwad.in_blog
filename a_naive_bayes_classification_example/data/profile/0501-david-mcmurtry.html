			Sir David McMurtry is the cofounder, CEO and chairman of Renishaw, a measurement instrument manufacturer based in the U.K. He began his career at Rolls-Royce, starting as an apprentice machinist and rising to become assistant chief of engine design at the Bristol plant before leaving to found Renishaw in 1973 with his colleague, John Deer.  Although Renishaw's headquarters are still located in a former 19th-century textile mill, it makes products with applications from high-tech manufacturing to neurosurgery. The company, which distributes products from 79 locations in 35 countries, has begun supplying high-tech laser components used by drones and self-driving cars. In 1994, Queen Elizabeth made him a Commander of the Order to the British Empire for "services to Science and Technology." McMurtry invented or co-invented more than 150 Renishaw products and holds several hundred patents.
