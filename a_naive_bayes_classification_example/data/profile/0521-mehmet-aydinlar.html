			Mehmet Ali Aydinlar leads Turkey's largest chain of private hospitals, the Acibadem Healthcare Group. He build the company after starting out as a consultant in the same field, took it public in 2000, and brought in a partner, Abraaj Capital, in 2008. The company was delisted in 2012 after Aydinlar struck a deal with Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund and IHH Healthcare Berhad, a Kuala Lumpur-based healthcare services provider focused on Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.  Aydinlar exchanged Acibadem shares for cash and stock in IHH; he now owns 25% of Acibadem, which is expanding into the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia and Iraq.
