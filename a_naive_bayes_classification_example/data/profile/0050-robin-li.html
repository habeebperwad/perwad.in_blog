			Robin Li, the CEO of Internet search leader Baidu, had a tough year in 2016. Baidu faced negative publicity over ineffective drugs sold on its medical sites, and Li was criticized for trying to buy Baidu's popular iQiyi video channel at a bargain basement price from the publicly-traded company (the plan was dropped). Some good news: In October 2016 Baidu set up a $3 billion investment fund that will target Internet companies in China.  And in February 2017, IQiyi, the Netflix-like streaming video subsidiary of Baidu, raised $1.5 billion in convertible notes, with Baidu ponying up $300 million. Li cofounded Baidu in 2000.
