			In 1870, August von Finck Jr.'s grandfather, Wilhelm von Finck, founded Merck, Finck & Co., the private bank that spawned, among other companies, insurers Munich Re and Allianz and the Loewenbraeu breweries.  With proceeds from the 1990 sale (to Barclay's Bank) of Allianz shares as well as Merck, Finck & Co., August von Finck Jr. has invested in a diversified portfolio that includes real estate and industrial companies. His 15% stake in Switzerland's Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world's leading verification, testing and certification organization, is worth over $2 billion. His oldest son, August Francois, who has a background in banking and an M.B.A. from Georgetown University, serves with him on the board of SGS. Residing in Schloss Weinfelden, a castle located in the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland, August von Finck Jr. maintains a low profile. Little is known about his personal interests.
