			Chey Tae-Won returned as SK Group chairman in February 2016, 3 years after he was sentenced to prison for embezzlement and stepped down from the boards of all SK companies. Key segments for SK Group include telecommunications, IT services and semiconductors and digital storage solutions; chemicals, energy and biopharmaceuticals; and the development and construction of plants and major infrastructure products.  The company has been moving into higher-growth industries, such as biotechnology, liquid natural gas and IT services. In December 2015, he made news by revealing, in a letter written to the Korean daily Segye Ilbo, that he'd fathered a child with another woman and would seek to divorce his wife, Roh Soh-Yeong, daughter of Korea's former president Roh Tae-Woo. The status of the divorce is not clear.
