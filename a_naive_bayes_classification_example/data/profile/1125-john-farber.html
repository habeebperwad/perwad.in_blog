			John Farber is the longtime chairman of ICC Industries, which trades basic and specialty chemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals globally. He started the company in 1952 as a chemical trading division of his father-in-law's textiles export-import firm, Leslie Kleyman Corporation.  Farber's family left Romania after his father's business, United Factory for Varnishes and Paints, was nationalized following World War II. Farber first traveled to Israel before making his way to New York to study chemistry for his doctorate at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. In the 1990s he bought back his father's old Romanian factory.
