			William and Victor Fung's Li & Fung is a middleman between Chinese manufacturers and retailers in the U.S. and Europe. Still the world's largest supplier of clothes and toys, the company is seen as a bellwether of the global retail sector.  But the brothers' fortune has fallen dramatically since 2011 as more brands take greater control of their supply chain by dealing with factories themselves. Fung Pak-liu cofounded the company in 1906 with Li To-ming, who sold his stakes to the Fungs four decades later. Pak-liu's grandson Victor chaired Li & Fung until younger brother William took over in 2012. Victor's son Spencer has been serving as Li & Fung's chief executive since 2014; in 2016 daughter Sabrina succeeded uncle William as deputy chairman of the family's menswear retailer Trinity. The other two members of the fourth generation, Victor's younger son Stephen and William's son Terence, have also been rising in the family business.
