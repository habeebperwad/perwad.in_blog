			Indian-born Singapore resident Arvind Tiku, who has been living in the city-state since 2007, has interests in oil and gas, property and renewable energy, held through his private holding outfit, AT Holdings.  Tiku left India at age 18 to study mechanical engineering in Russia and worked as a commodities trader before branching out on his own in oil and gas in Kazakhstan. Among much else, he owns a minority stake in London-listed Kazakh oil explorer Nostrum Oil & Gas along with steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Kazakh billionaire Timur Kulibaev, son-in-law of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. In 2010, he and Kulibaev became embroiled in a criminal case linked to the sale of Kazakh oil assets to the Chinese, but a Swiss court cleared them of all charges three years later.
