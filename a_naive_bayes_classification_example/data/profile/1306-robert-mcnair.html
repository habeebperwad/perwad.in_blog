			Robert "Bob" McNair is the man who brought football back to Houston. McNair is the principal owner of the Houston Texans. Since McNair cofounded the team in 1999, the value of the Texans has grown to $2.5 billion, thanks in part to increased revenues from stadium and broadcasting rights league-wide.  His original fortune came from the 1999 sale of power generator Cogen Technologies to Enron for $1.5 billion. In 2015 McNair won his battle with two types of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma, thanks to early detection and cutting edge treatments including immunotherapy. In recent years, his family foundation has donated to a number of universities, including Columbia, Baylor, and his alma mater, the University of South Carolina.
