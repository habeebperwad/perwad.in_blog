			Philip Niarchos is the oldest son of the late Stavros Niarchos, one of the world's richest shipping magnates. The oldest of his four children with Eugenia Livianos,  he inherited the bulk of his father's art collection.  Bought in 1957 for $3 million from actor Edward G. Robinson, who needed to pay for his divorce, the art collection includes some of the world's most recognizable pieces. It is said to be the largest private collection of works by Van Gogh, including a self portrait of the Dutch master after he chopped off his ear. The collection also includes one of the most iconic works by Pablo Picasso, "Yo, Picasso." Since inheriting the collection, Philip has added post-war and contemporary works, including pieces by Andy Warhol and Maurizio Cattelan. Philip is credited by some as having put Haitian-American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in the category of absolute masters after buying a self-portrait of his for a then-record $3.3 million in 1982.
