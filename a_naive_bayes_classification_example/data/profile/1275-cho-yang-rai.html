			Cho Yang-Rai chairs Hankook Tire Worldwide, whose affiliate, Hankook Tire, is one of the world's biggest tire manufacturers. It's broken into the high-end market by supplying Mercedes-Benz since 2013 and BMW's new 7-series sedans in 2016. Its next target will be ultra-high-performance cars such as Ferrari.  In 2016, it opened its first U.S. plant, in Tennessee. Cho inherited the business from his father Cho Hong-Hai who took over a ruined tire shop during the 1950s, shortly after the end of the Korean War.
