An Israeli immigrant, Gores grew up near Detroit and stocked shelves at his father's small grocery store.  His brother, Alec, is also a private equity billionaire.

A sports nut, he played football, basketball and baseball in high school and still coaches youth soccer and basketball teams. In 2011 Gores and Platinum Equity bought the NBA Detroit Pistons. In August 2015 he purchased Platinum Equity's stake, giving him 100% of the team's equity. He owns several homes in California and Michigan. In January 2016 Gores launched FlintNow, a campaign to raise private sector funds to address the Flint, Mich., water crisis.
