			The net worth of Vincent McMahon, the World Wrestling Entertainment CEO, has bounced up and down like a wrestler hitting the ropes. He's back in the ring with the world's richest in 2017 after a 50% jump in WWE's stock in the 12 months ending February, partly because of the success of WWE's subscription streaming service.  A third generation wrestling promoter, McMahon grew up in a trailer park in North Carolina and joined his father's small wrestling company in 1972. He purchased the business 10 years later, then transformed the World Wrestling Federation from a regional operation into an international phenomenon. WWF (now WWE) went public in 1999; today its programs are broadcast in roughly 150 countries and more than 30 languages. His wife, Linda, was picked by Donald Trump to lead his Small Business Administration; she was confirmed in February 2017.
