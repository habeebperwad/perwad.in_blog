			Nearly two years after Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's husband, SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg, died unexpectedly at age 47, she announced that the social media company will give employees 20 days of bereavement leave.  She wrote about grief and resilience in her new book, "Option B," scheduled for release in April 2017. Sandberg has not shied away from criticizing President Donald Trump on everything from his immigration ban to anti-abortion measures. She has denied rumors that she plans to run for president in 2020. In November 2015, Sandberg donated $31 million in Facebook stock to a charitable fund, the majority of which will go to Lean In, her nonprofit that supports women in the workplace and women's empowerment groups. She also pledged $1 million to Planned Parenthood in early 2017. The Harvard M.B.A., who was once chief of staff to then Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, has helped boost revenues at Facebook 66-fold since becoming COO in 2008.
