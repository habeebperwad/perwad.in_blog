			German Khan's Alfa Group, which he shares with fellow billionaires and college buddies Mikhail Fridman and Alexei Kuzmichev, is the biggest financial and industrial investment group in Russia. Khan worked as executive director of TNK-BP, the group's oil business, a joint venture with BP, since it was founded in 2003. He left the company in March 2013 after Alfa Group and partners sold a 50% stake in TNK-BP to state-owned oil company Rosneft for $28 billion.  Khan got $3.3 billion in cash from the deal. That same year Alfa Group created a new company, LetterOne Holdings S.A. (L1), which holds its foreign assets and handles foreign acquisitions using the money from the TNK-BP sale. A Kiev native, he moved to Moscow to study.
