			Manuel Jove's fortune stems from Fadesa Inmobiliaria, a business he founded in 1980 and developed into one of Spain's leading property companies. Jove, a carpenter by trade, took the company public in 2004 and then sold his 55% stake to real estate group Martinsa for $3 billion in 2006, just before the collapse of the Spanish real estate bubble.  Martinsa filed for bankruptcy two years later and in March 2011 sued Jove for $2 billion, claiming that the purchase price of Fadesa had been inflated. Jove prevailed in court in 2012, even winning his legal costs. His Inveravante investment group is now investing more than $450 million into two luxury developments in Morocco. Jove collects art from the Spanish province of Galicia and enjoys woodworking.
