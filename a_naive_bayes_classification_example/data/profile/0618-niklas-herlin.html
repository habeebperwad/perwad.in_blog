			Niklas Herlin is the great-grandson of Harald Herlin, who invested in elevator and escalator manufacturer Kone in 1924. After his father's death in 2003, Niklas and his siblings Ilkka and Ilona discovered their father had rewritten his will in 1999 and left most of the ownership in Kone to their brother Antti.  Angered that they had never been informed, the siblings battled for control. The dispute ended in 2005, with Kone being split in two. Antti maintained control over the core elevator business, still called Kone. He and two of his siblings, also billionaires, received a minority stake in Kone and a majority stake in Cargotec, a cargo machinery and solutions outfit that was once a division of Kone. Niklas is also the second-largest shareholder in Finnish publishing company Alma Media.
