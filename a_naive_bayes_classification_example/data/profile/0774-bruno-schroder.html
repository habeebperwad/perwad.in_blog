			Bruno Schroder is the great-grandson of John Henry Schroder, the co-founder of the the 213-year-old financial-services powerhouse Schroders, which has about $491 billion in assets under management. He was appointed a director of the firm in 1963; he still holds that position, making him the longest-serving non-executive board member of any company on London's FTSE 100 stock exchange.  Next to him on the board is his nephew, Philip Mallinckrodt. In his spare time, Schroder flies his private plane and breeds Middle White pigs at his estate--Dunlossit House--in Islay, Scotland. A supporter of Scottish independence, he donated money to the 2014 campaign for Scotland to leave the U.K. He also reportedly owns 2% of The Economist. Schroder committed nearly $123,000 last year to lobbying groups to stop Brexit and to stop Scotland from leaving the UK.
