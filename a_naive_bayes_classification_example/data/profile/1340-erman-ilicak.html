			Established in 1993 by Erman Ilicak, Ronesans Holding -- active in the fields of construction, real estate investment, energy production, health and education -- now operates in 23 countries. A key focus has been investing in European construction firms: Austria's Porr AG in 2009, the Swiss Hergiswill and the German Heitcamp in 2013, and the Netherlands' Ballast Nedam NV in 2015. One of Turkey's largest real estate developers, the group owns 12 shopping malls, two city hotels ad 10 office buildings in Turkey and Russia.  In 2015, under the auspices of the Turkish Public Private Partnership, it generated approximately $200 million of rental income. Ronesans also won the tender for the construction and subsequent leasing to 13 large state hospitals; upon completion, they'll be administered in conjunction with the Turkish Ministry of Health for 25 years.
