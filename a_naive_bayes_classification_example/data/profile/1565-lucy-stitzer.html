			Lucy Stitzer chairs Waycrosse, the investment company of the Cargill and MacMillan families, one of the richest clans in America. She is the great-great granddaughter of W.W. Cargill, who founded Cargill in 1865 with a single warehouse on the end of an Iowa railroad line.  Today the company is the largest private company in America, with 150,000 employees spread out over every continent but Antarctica. Stitzer and each of her three billionaire sisters inherited estimated 3% stakes in the company when their father, W. Duncan MacMillan, died in 2006. Stitzer's husband, Todd, is the former CEO of candy company Cadbury Schweppes. He now runs New York investment firm Hamlin Capital Management, and Stitzer sits on its advisory board.
