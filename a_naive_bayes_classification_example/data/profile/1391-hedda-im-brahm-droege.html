			Hedda im Brahm Droege and husband Walter Droege founded Droege International Group in 1988 and have since turned the Dusseldorf headquartered company into one of the world's largest business consulting, restructuring and corporate advisory practices, with annual revenues topping $10 billion and 62,000 people working in offices in 30 countries.  Droege has a hybrid business model, providing expertise to external consulting clients and making direct "buy and build" investments (mostly in corporate subsidiaries and medium-size companies in special situations) for its own portfolio. It also has a venture program aimed at emerging high-growth companies with innovative business models applicable to traditional sectors in which the portfolio companies of Droege Group operate. By acting like entrepreneurs and providing capital, management resources and "value-add" know-how, Droege follows the principle of "Entrepreneurship as a Service" in engaging with clients seeking advice in developing and implementing future-oriented, digital business models. Hedda, an economist by training, owns 22% of the company; Walter, who serves as the company's CEO and executive managing director, owns the rest. She is vice-chairwoman of the supervisory board.
