			Andrea Reimann-Ciardelli is a descendant of chemist Ludwig Reimann, who, in 1828, joined with Johann Adam Benckiser. Five years earlier, Benckiser had founded an eponymous chemical company. Reimann married one of his daughters and wound up owning the business, based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, after Johann's death.  Great-grandson Albert Reimann Jr. took the reins after his father died in 1952, and added consumer goods. Upon Albert's death in 1984, Andrea and eight other heirs each inherited 11.1% of Luxembourg-based Investment holding JAB Holding Company s.Ã .r.l (JAB). Today, JAB owns stakes in a variety of consumer products companies including Reckitt Benckiser -- a multinational with health, hygiene and home products formed via the 1999 merger of the Reimann family business with Britain's Reckitt & Colman Ltd. -- Peet's Coffee & Tea and Coty, a maker of perfume and beauty products. Only four of the original nine Reimann heirs retain an interest in JAB. Reimann-Ciardelli, now a U.S. citizen, sold her JAB stake for close to $1 billion in 2003.
