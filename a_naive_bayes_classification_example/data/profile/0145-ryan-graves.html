			Ryan Graves was the first employee hired at Uber, the ride-hailing service now valued by investors at $68 billion. Uber is competing with taxi services across the U.S. and in more than 70 other countries.  In August 2016, Graves stepped down from his role as president and was replaced by Jeffrey Jones, who had been the chief marketing officer at Target. Graves is staying on at Uber as the company's "resident entrepreneur and builder" leading Uber's People Operations and focusing on initiatives like uberEATS, a food delivery service. Graves joined Uber in 2010 when Travis Kalanick, Uber's cofounder and current CEO, tweeted that he was looking for a product manager. Graves, who had worked at GE and interned at Foursquare, famously responded, "here's a tip. email me :)" It worked. Graves had a brief stint as CEO and was replaced by Kalanick in 2010.
