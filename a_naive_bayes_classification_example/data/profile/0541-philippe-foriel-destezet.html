			Philippe Foriel-Destezet stepped down as co-chairman of Swiss staffing firm Adecco in 2005 and was made an honorary president in 2006. Through his Luxembourg holding company, Akila Finance, he retains about 4.7% of the firm.  Foriel-Destezet founded his staffing company, Ecco, in 1964; by the 1980s it was France's largest supplier of temporary personnel. He merged the firm with Klaus Jacobs's Swiss firm Adia to create Adecco in 1996. The company now employs more than 33,000 people full-time across 5,100 branches in over 60 countries. Foriel-Destezet has donated to HEC Foundation in France, a 130-year old institution that gives scholarships and grants to students and professors at HEC Paris, one of France's elite business schools, to pursue high-level research and innovation focused on teaching tools.
