			While other startups compares themselves to Uber, Travis Kalanick is thinking about what's next: from people to freight, if something is in motion, he wants to be at the center of it. Kalanick has already driven his taxi-killing startup from nothing to a valuation of $68 billion in just seven years.  In June 2016 the company raised a massive $5.5 billion financing round that included a large investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. But despite investing those billions around the world, Uber can't win everywhere. In July 2016, it admitted defeat in China, striking a deal that gives it 20% of rival Didi Chuxing in exchange for leaving the country. Kalanick started his first business, an online file-exchange service called Scour, with some UCLA classmates. He dropped out of UCLA in 1998 to work at the startup full time. It was later sued by the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America before filing for bankruptcy in 2000. His second company, another file-sharing company called RedSwoosh, was sold to Akamai in an all-stock deal valued at $18.7 million in 2007.
