			Hotelier Jasminder Singh purchased his first hotel, the Edwardian, in 1975, which became the namesake of his budding luxury hotel group based in London. Over nearly two decades, he added 11 additional hotels to the portfolio.  In 1993 he partnered with Radisson and now has 12 Radisson Blu Edwardian boutique hotels across London's West End, and a few scattered in Manchester and Kensington.  It also owns the May Fair Hotel, a 400-room, high-end hotel in London. Singh, who is the executive chairman, took his father to court in 2012 when his father tried to claim part of the fortune. Both Seiks, the father argued that within their culture wealth is shared among generations and as a result he had rights to some of his son's self made fortune. The court sided with Jasminder; his father passed away soon after the decision.
