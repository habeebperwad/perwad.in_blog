			Singapore-based American metals magnate Robert Friedland, who founded and chairs Toronto-listed Ivanhoe Mines is developing a large copper mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with China's Zijin Mining.  Activist group MiningWatch Canada accused Ivanhoe in May 2016 of human rights abuses in its flagship project in South Africa's Ivanplats Platreefs Project, in which a Japanese consortium led by Itochu also has a 10% stake. Ivanhoe denied the allegations and said they were false. Friedland also owns 19.3% in Australia-listed CleanTeQ, whose cobalt and nickel mine will be a supplier to makers of lithium-ion batteries that are used in electric vehicles. In March, his Hollywood production company Ivanhoe Pictures merged with Sidney Kimmel Entertainment to form SK Global, which will produce and finance international television and film content.
