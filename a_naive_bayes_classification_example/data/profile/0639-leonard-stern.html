			Leonard Stern's father Max arrived in New York from Germany in 1926 with 5,000 canaries; a friend's payment on a loan. After selling the birds, Max opened Hartz Mountain, which became a big player in the pet industry.  Stern joined Hartz in 1959, eventually buying up real estate and selling the pet business. Stern owns more than 37 million square feet of property in New Jersey and New York, plus a luxury tower in Chicago. He also owns several warehouses in Georgia.
