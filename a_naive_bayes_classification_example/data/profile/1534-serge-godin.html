			Serge Godin founded Canadian tech firm CGI Group in 1976 at age 26. He was president and CEO of the $10.7-billion (sales) company, which specializes in IT and business process services, until becoming chairman in 2006. The firm won a $93.7 million contract to help develop the Healthcare. gov website, making headlines for its role in the site's botched launch in October 2013. Godin has overseen more than 70 acquisitions, including the 1998 purchase of Bell Canada's telecom services subsidiary, Bell Sygma, which nearly doubled the size of the company at the time. One of nine children, at age 12 Godin started working for his father, who had just a fifth-grade education, at the family's sawmill. When the uninsured mill burned down, Godin worked full-time -- at a convenience store after school on weekdays and at a dry cleaner's on Saturdays -- to help pay the bills. After studying computer science and earning an MBA from Quebec's Universit√© Laval, he worked for two consulting firms before using $5,000 in savings to start CGI Group.
