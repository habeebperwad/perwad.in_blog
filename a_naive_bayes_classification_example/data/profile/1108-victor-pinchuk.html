These days the company, which lost all of its business in Russia during its occupation of Crimea, is weighted down by heavy debts.  The billionaire wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal in December 2016 that discussed the "painful compromises" Ukraine must make to make peace with Russia. His comments provoked strong criticism from many in Ukraine. In January 2017, he held his annual lunch on Ukraine at the World Economic Forum at Davos.
