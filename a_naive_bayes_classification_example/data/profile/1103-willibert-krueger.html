			In 1971, Willibert Krueger took over the annex of his parents' small food wholesale business and began to manufacture instant tea. His "granulated" tea concept proved a hit, with 10 million packets produced in 1976. In Germany, Krueger is closely identified with a wide range of "instant" products including milk powder, powdered sweetener or instant drink powder, coffee whitener, single-serving coffee capsules, fruit powder and baby food.  Also active in the health-and-wellness space, the company manufactures and markets non-prescription medicines, OTC products, vitamins and pharmaceutical cosmetics. It's also a contract manufacturer and bulk producer of food ingredients, commodities and semi-finished products used, for example, in cheese, sandwich spreads, dietary foods and ice cream. Willibert owns 50% of the company, which generates around $2 billion in annual revenue, and loves playing tennis in his free time. His son Marc, director of Krueger GmbH & Co. KG, is heir apparent.
