			Real estate magnates Sol and Eddie Zakay are chairman and deputy-chairman of Topland Group, an investment group with a portfolio of over 165 commercial properties and 37 hotels, 28 of which are owned and operated directly.  Speaking of the outlook for 2017, Sol reiterated Topland's commitment to expanding its hotel and healthcare businesses. One new venture is a hotel in Manchester being made entirely out of shipping containers, and slated for completion in 2017. Sol originally founded the group in the late 1980s but left the UK for Gbraltar after a 50% tax rate on high earners was enacted. He left Gibraltar in 2013, and is now back in the UK.
