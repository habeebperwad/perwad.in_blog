			One of Latin America's most successful bankers, Jaime Gilinski Bacal built Banco GNB Sudameris into a multinational bank with $9 billion in assets through a series of acquisitions. In 2003 he bought assets from Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo, later merged them with Banco Tequendama of Peru and an ATM network in Colombia called Servibanca.  Today Banco GNB Sudameris operates in Colombia, Paraguay and Peru. Gilinski also owns a 2% stake in publicly traded Banco Sabadell, the fourth largest private banking group in Spain. In Panama, Gilinski partnered with the British billionaire brothers Ian and Richard Livingstone to develop Panama Pacifico, a 4,450-acre development on the former U.S. Howard Air Force Base, strategically located on the banks of the Panama Canal. The project now houses more than 270 multinational tenants, including 3M, Dell and Caterpillar. Gilinski also owns hotels in Bogota and Cartagena, Colombia. The Colombian banker got his start in the U.S., where he obtained an MBA from Harvard in 1980, then worked in Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions division.
