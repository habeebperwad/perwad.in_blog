			Samuel Tak Lee's property empire stretches from Hong Kong and London to Geneva and Tokyo. The centerpiece is Langham Estate, a swath of prime retail and office space in London's West End, purchased by Lee in 1994. Since then he's built up his holdings to some 14 acres between the neighborhoods of Soho and Mayfair.
