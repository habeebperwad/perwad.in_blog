			Henadiy Boholyubov and Ihor Kolomoysky founded PrivatBank with $1 million in capital in the early 1990s. Over the years it grew to be a key bank in Ukraine, handling more than a third of private deposits and serving approximately half of the country's entire population.  Then in 2016, Ukraine's government nationalized the bank. Boholyubov has other assets including an oil business and ferroalloys manufacturer. He agreed in November 2016 to sell his Australian  ferroalloys company Consolidated Minerals to China's Tian Yuan Manganese. He is a generous donor to jewish causes.
