			Alexei Kuzmichev controls Alfa Group, one of the biggest financial and industrial groups in Russia, with fellow billionaires and college pals German Khan and Mikhail Fridman. They also control LetterOne, which holds Alfa's international assets.  The college friends started Alfa Bank in 1991; it is now the second-biggest private bank in Russia. The trio bought Tyumen Oil from the state in the late 1990s and merged it with BP's Russian assets, forming TNK-BP. In 2013 Alfa Group and its partners   sold a 50% stake in TNK-BP to state-owned Rosneft for $28 billion. Kuzmichev got more than $2.5 billion in cash from that deal.  A collector of contemporary art, Kuzmichev bought Dream More Work Less by Sam Durant in 2012 at Art Basel in Miami Beach. He is friends with photographer Trevor Paglen, and owns one of Paglen's most famous works, the night photo of NSA.
