			Former L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling has finally settled the legal fight over the 2014 sale of his basketball team to fellow billionaire Steve Ballmer. In November 2016 he voluntarily dismissed his antitrust suit against his wife Shelly and the NBA.  Shelly sold the team for $2 billion after Sterling ignited a firestorm when a tape of his racist remarks to then-mistress V. Stiviano surfaced. The couple called off their divorce in March 2016, and Sterling's lawyer disputed charges that he has developed dementia. The Chicago-native, who was born Donald Tokowitz to Jewish immigrants, built his fortune largely by buying down-at-the-heels apartment buildings in Los Angeles. Today he owns a swath of apartments in L.A.'s Westside and Koreatown, as well as the Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel.
