			Early Silicon Valley property baron Richard "Dick" Peery partnered with Stanford grad John Arrillaga, buying farmland in the 1960s and turning it into office parks. Peery, who dropped out of the Stanford MBA program, had gained some early experience managing his father's small property portfolio.  In 2006 Peery and Arrillaga sold many of their buildings for $1.1 billion. They now own about 3.3 million square feet of office space throughout the Valley and count Google and Intuit as tenants. Peery's son Dave runs the family foundation, which supports social entrepreneurs and organizations addressing poverty in the San Francisco area and around the world.
