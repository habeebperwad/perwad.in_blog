			Diamond tycoon Beny Steinmetz is the owner of BSGR, an embattled mining company with a heavy presence in Africa. Born and raised in Israel, Steinmetz moved to Belgium in 1978 to start a diamond business and later founded what would become the Steinmetz Diamond Group with his brother.  Steinmetz's iron ore mining efforts in Guinea beginning in 2008 have erupted into a political and legal battlefield. Steinmetz's BSGR acquired iron ore mining rights from the late Guinean dictator Lansana Conté for free, after Conté stripped the rights from Australian mining giant Rio Tinto. In 2010, Steinmetz sold 51% of the mining rights to Brazilian multinational Vale for $2.5 billion, but as of February 2016 he had only collected $500 million. Rio Tinto sued BSGR in New York but the case was thrown out in November 2015. Guinea's first democratically elected president, Alpha Condé, decided in April 2014 to strip BSGR of its interests in the Simandou region after an inquiry determined they were illegally obtained and is the in process of auctioning them off. BSGR is asking an international tribunal to halt the proceedings and return its claim to the rights. Steinmetz was held under house arrest in Israel in connection to bribery allegations against him related to BSGR's project in Guinea. He was not charged and was released in January 2017; BSGR described the allegations as "baseless."
