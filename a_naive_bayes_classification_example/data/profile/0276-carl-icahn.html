			Carl Icahn has always styled himself as the consummate outsider, but with his friend Donald Trump in the White House Icahn now has an insider's role. He is advising the Trump Administration on issues involving regulatory overhaul, helping to select the heads of key regulatory agencies like the Securities & Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Not everything, however, has been going Icahn's way. He is coming off one of the worst stretches of his investment career with his investment fund falling by 20.3% in 2016, its third-straight year of losses. It fell by 18% in 2015. Icahn's positions in energy and commodities companies have been hit by weak commodities prices and his hedges against the stock market's rise have hurt his performance. Born in Queens, Icahn has been shaking up corporate America for years by taking stakes in publicly-traded companies and agitating for change.
