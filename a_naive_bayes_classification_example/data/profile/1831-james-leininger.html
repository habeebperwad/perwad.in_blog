			Former emergency room doctor James Leininger is now a Texas GOP heavyweight. A champion of school reform, Leininger favors school choice, home schooling and vouchers. He founded the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 1989 to support free-market policies and research.  Leininger, also known simply as "Doctor Jim," made his fortune founding medical devices company Kinetic Concepts (KCI), which focuses on wound care. Leininger started KCI in a one-bedroom apartment in 1976. In November 2012 a consortium of private equity firms led by Apax Partners closed a $6.3 billion acquisition of the company. Leininger was the largest individual shareholder and sold his stake when Apax took the company private. Since then he has mostly invested through his Medcare Investment Funds, which manage $1 billion in assets. In addition to funneling money toward school reform, he is a longtime donor to Texas Gov. Rick Perry. He enjoys fishing, bow hunting, scuba diving and hiking, and he has a small stake in the San Antonio Spurs.
