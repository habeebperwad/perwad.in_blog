			One of Australia's biggest landlords with a portfolio that covers the country, Stanley Perron owns mostly shopping malls and commercial high-rises plus regional airports and city parking garages. He also receives a small iron-ore royalty and owns a Toyota distributorship, awarded to him personally by the Toyoda family more than 50 years ago.  His first job as a boy was carving boxes to hold handkerchiefs and selling them door-to-door in the gold mining town of Kalgoorlie. He tried his hand at everything from brick-making to running an ice rink before settling on cars and property.
