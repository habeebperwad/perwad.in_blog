			Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert has been the most active developer in downtown Detroit, acquiring and rehabbing some 95 properties since early 2011, including the Greektown Casino and Hotel. Now he is stepping up his ambitions with proposals to construct a new major league soccer stadium and the city's tallest skyscraper.  Gilbert started a small mortgage company in 1985 with $5,000 made from delivering pizzas in college. He sold it to Intuit for $532 million in 1999 and bought it back 3 years later for $64 million. Now Quicken Loans is the nation's largest FinTech lender, with a record loan volume of $96 billion in 2016. His Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA Championship in 2016 for the first time.
