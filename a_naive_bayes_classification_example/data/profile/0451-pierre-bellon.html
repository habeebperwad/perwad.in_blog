			Once a catering and cruise outfit with just one company restaurant in Marseilles, today Sodexo is now one of the  world's 20 largest employers, with 420,000 people on its payroll. Founded by Pierre Bellon in 1966, Sodexo began expanding internationally in 1971 and now feeds 75 million people in 80 countries daily at schools, hospitals, prisons and five U. S. Air Force bases. Sodexo caters the Dakar Road Rally and Royal Ascot horse races, and has provided services for six Olympic games since 1988. In 2011, it bought gourmet food business Lenotre; it also owns a 90% stake in Yachts de Paris, one of the Seine's best-known cruise companies. Bellon stepped down as chief executive in 2005 and remained chairman until January 2016, when his daughter Sophie Bellon replaced him as head of the board. He is keeping it in the family in other ways, too: Thanks to a 2008 agreement, Bellon's grandchildren and their descendants cannot sell Bellon SA shares to anyone outside the clan until 2058.
