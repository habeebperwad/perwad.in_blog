			The cowboy cable king is wheeling and dealing again. John Malone's Liberty Media, which owns MLB's Atlanta Braves, reached an agreement in September 2016 to buy auto-racing league Formula One for $4.4 billion.  In May 2016, the Federal Communications Commission approved his Charter Communications' $85 billion merger with Time Warner, and also its $12.2 billion acquisition of cable TV company Bright House Networks. A month later, Lions Gate acquired cable and satellite TV company Starz; he has stakes in both. The Connecticut native is also the nation's biggest individual landowner, with over two million acres across seven states. Malone started his career at Bell Telephone Laboratories.
