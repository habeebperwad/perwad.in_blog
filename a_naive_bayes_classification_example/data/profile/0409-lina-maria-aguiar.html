			Lina Maria Aguiar inherited a stake in Bradesco, one of Brazil's largest banks. Abandoned as a baby in 1938 in front of a branch of Bradesco, she was adopted by the bank's founder, Amador Aguiar. Her twin sister Lia and her sister Maria Angela, also billionaires, were adopted by Aguiar years later.  Amador Aguiar died in 1991, and for years the sisters fought in Brazilian courts over the late banker's will, which was annulled in favor of Aguiar's second wife and former personal secretary, whom he married less than five months before his death.  In addition to Bradesco, the sisters also own shares of Bradespar, the bank's non-financial arm, which holds a major stake in Vale SA, the world's largest iron-ore producer.
