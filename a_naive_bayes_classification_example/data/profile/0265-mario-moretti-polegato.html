			Mario Moretti Polegato founded shoemaker Geox in 1995, with his patented "breathable shoe" technology. The son of winemakers, he had worked in the family business after graduating from university. But in 1989 he got hot while walking in Nevada and cut holes in his shoes, sparking the idea to invent a shoe membrane that let in air but stopped dirt and water.  Nike turned down the idea. Moretti took Geox public in 2004. In 2015, his company had revenues of $900 million from selling shoes all over the world. In late 2015, he inked a distribution deal with Hong Kong-listed Pou Sheng International, a leading footwear retailer in China. Moretti Polegato spends much of his time teaching intellectual property at universities around the world. In 2004, he founded il Ponte del Sorriso ("Bridge of Smiles"), a nonprofit that helps orphaned Romanians.
