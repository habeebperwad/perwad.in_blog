			Son of immigrants from southern Italy, James Leprino owns the world's largest mozzarella cheese maker. His Leprino Foods sells ingredients to Domino's, Papa John's, Pizza Hut and Little Caesar's. The company is completing construction of a $300 million processing facility in Northern Colorado, which will produce more than 500,000 pounds of cheese a day when it is finalized in 2017. The company sees increasing sales from producing cheese by-products like whey protein, lactose, and sweet whey powder used in baby formula and yogurt.  Leprino's father started the business in the 1950s; today it has estimated sales of $3 billion with factories in the U.S., joint venture factories in the U.K. and offices in Singapore, Tokyo and Shanghai.
