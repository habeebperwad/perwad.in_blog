			Doug Leone is managing partner at esteemed Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and has reaped the rewards of the firm's successful tech investments, from Google and YouTube to Zappos and LinkedIn.  An Italian immigrant from Genoa, Leone moved to Mount Vernon, N.Y., at age 11 with his family and was called "Pasta" in high school. At Sequoia, he and his partners like to invest in hungry outsiders, such as Ukrainian immigrant and WhatsApp founder Jan Koum. In 2014, Sequoia's partners had a big payday with the sale of WhatsApp, which Facebook snatched up for nearly $22 billion in cash and shares.
