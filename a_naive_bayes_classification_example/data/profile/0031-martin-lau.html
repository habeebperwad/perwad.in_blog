			The president of Tencent since 2006, Martin Lau, or Lau Chi Ping, is called the Salary Emperor for building a fortune as an executive, not a founder, of the internet company. He became a billionaire for the first time in 2017 after Tencent shares jumped by a third over the previous year.  Beijing-born, he grew up in Hong Kong and was educated in the U.S. He left Goldman Sachs to join Tencent in 2005 as chief strategy and investment officer. He's expanded the Tencent empire with an agreement in June 2016 to acquire up to 84% of Finnish mobile-game-maker Supercell in a transaction valuing it at $10.2 billion. He sits on the board of several overseas-listed mainland companies, such as e-commerce giant JD.com.
