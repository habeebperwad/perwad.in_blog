			Retail tycoon Abilio dos Santos Diniz sold his last remaining shares of Grupo Pao de Acucar in 2014 for $150 million, marking his exit from the company founded by his father, a Portuguese immigrant, in 1948. Under Diniz's management, Grupo Pao de Acucar became Brazil's largest retailer.  In 2012, he sold a stake of the company to Groupe Casino, France's second-largest retailer. Soon after, the relationship with the French partner went awry and Diniz ceded control of Grupo Pao de Acucar to Casino in September 2013. Diniz has since been chairman of the board of meat processor Brasil Foods (BRF), one of Grupo Pao de Acucar's largest suppliers. In 2016, Diniz became one of the largest individual shareholders of Carrefour SA and was nominated to the board of the French retailer that has over 380 thousand employees worldwide. In 1989 Diniz was kidnapped by Canadian terrorists and held underground for seven days until the federal police set him free. He's penned a memoir describing his six tenets to a balanced life--physical activity, nutrition, stress management, self-knowledge, love and faith. He is a fan of Sao Paulo FC, one of Brazil's largest teams, and often blogs and tweets about the team.
