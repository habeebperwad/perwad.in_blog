			Hedge fund manager David Einhorn bounced back from his worst year since the financial crisis with an 8.4% gain in his hedge fund Greenlight Capital. The famed short seller benefited from a savvy bet on DuPont spinoff Chemours, which more than tripled in 2016. Einhorn believes tax cuts under President Trump will benefit high-rate paying firms like Amerco and Dillards, in addition to Apple.  Einhorn is adding to his bets on General Motors, believing that higher wages will sustain the auto market, and he remains short high-priced Internet stocks and oil frackers. As a hedge against President Trump's inconsistency, Einhorn continues to hold a major position in gold.
