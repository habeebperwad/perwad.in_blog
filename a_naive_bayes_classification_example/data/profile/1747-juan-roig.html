			The richest grocer in Spain, Juan Roig is president of grocery store giant Mercadona, hauls in $22.8 billion in revenues a year. Roig, his brother Fernando and wife Hortensia Herrero, also billionaires, bought the chain in 1981 from the Roigs' father when it was just an eight-store operation.  By 2006, they had opened their 1,000th store. The economic crisis slammed most of Spain's economy but did nothing to slow down Mercadona's growth. Today the Roig family has 1,614 locations spread across the country. The company prides itself on the long tenure of its 79,000 employees, who get a 25% cut of the company's pretax profits. Juan Roig created an "innovation cluster" in Valencia, Spain, where he invests in young entrepreneurs. He is the largest shareholder of the Valencia Basket Club, a professional basketball team in his hometown.
