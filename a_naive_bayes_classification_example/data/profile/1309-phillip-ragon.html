He founded the company in 1978 and owns all of it.  In 2009, following a trip to South Africa where Ragon witnessed the ravages of AIDS, he and his wife Susan (an executive at InterSystems) established the Ragon Institute in partnership with Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard and MIT to pursue an HIV vaccine.
