			Indian pharma magnate Hasmukh Chudgar enjoys a boost thanks to rising sales and profits at his privately held generics maker Intas Pharmaceuticals. The company, which has Temasek and ChrysCapital as key investors, is run by his sons Nimish and Binish.  In what was its biggest overseas acquisition, Intas agreed last October to buy the U.K. and Irish units of Israeli generics maker Teva Pharmaceuticals for $750 million. Chudgar founded the the Ahmedabad- headquartered company in 1977 but is no longer involved in operations.
