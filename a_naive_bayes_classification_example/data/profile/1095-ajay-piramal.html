			Ajay Piramal's fortune more than doubled in the past year, partly due to new information on his real estate holdings. He also got a boost from an uptick in shares of flagship Piramal Enterprises, which  rose on news that its lucrative financial services business would be spun off and listed separately.   Piramal started out in his family's textile business at age 22 and went on to build a pharma empire through a series of acquisitions. In 2010, he sold his  drug formulations business to Abbott Labs for $3.8 billion. Piramal has a board seat at Tata Sons, holding outfit of the Tata conglomerate.
