			John Sall founded business analytics software firm SAS with partner James Goodnight, whom he met at North Carolina State University. The firm celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2016 and is expanding operations in Dublin and the Asia Pacific region.  SAS was originally developed to analyze agricultural data; its analytics software is used by over 75,000 companies around the world. SAS revenue in 2016 was $3.2 billion. A history major at Beloit College in Wisconsin, Sall saw a weak job market in front of him upon graduation and opted for graduate work in economics and statistics, which led him to earn a masters in statistics from N.C. State. His interest in history continues; he sits on the advisory board of Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of Natural History. Sall owns a one-third stake in SAS. The company is known for employee-friendly programs that include sports leagues, day care and on-site dry cleaning. Sall and Goodnight also own a country club and a hotel, and founded private college prep school Cary Academy.
