			Peter Woo started his career with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York in 1972 after earning an MBA from Columbia University. He met his future wife, Bessie, daughter of shipping tycoon Y.K. Pao, in New York, and in 1975 he joined her family business in Hong Kong.  Woo relinquished his chairman's role at Wharf in 2015 and became "chief adviser." Beyond property, Wharf and its listed holding company, Wheelock & Co., control important telecom, port and retailing assets, including the luxury department store chain Lane Crawford. His wealth jumped by more than $2 billion in 2016 as shares in Wheelock soared, buoyed by strong earnings, sizable deals and renewed demand from mainland buyers. Son Douglas, heir apparent, chairs Wheelock.
