			In March 2015, Dutch entertainment mogul John de Mol sold his Talpa Media, creator of hit shows like "The Voice", to British ITV for an initial cash payment of $545 million. Assuming de Mol, who still heads the creative management, remains commited to creating new hit shows for Talpa Media and meets certain growth goals until 2022, the deal could eventually be worth up to $1.2 billion.  This is the second time de Mol made it big in reality television. With fellow billionaire Joop van den Ende, he founded Endemol, the production company responsible for international hits "Deal or No Deal," "Fear Factor," and "Big Brother." He sold Endemol for $5.3 billion to Spanish telecom giant Telefonica in 2000.
