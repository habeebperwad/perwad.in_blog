			Shin Dong-Bin is the youngest son of Shin Kyeok-Ho, who founded Lotte as a confectionary manufacturer in Japan in 1948 and expanded into Korea in 1967. Today, Lotte Group is Korea's largest retailer and has other interests ranging from food and beverages to chemicals, construction and professional baseball.  In February 2017, Lotte agreed to a land swap with the Korean government to house a controversial U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in response to North Korea threats. China, infuriated with the THAAD deployment due to its capabilities of tracking the country's own missiles, urged a boycott of Korean products and has reportedly shut down 23 Lotte Mart stores there, dealing a blow to Lotte's market share. Shin studied economics at Aoyama Gakuin University and has an M.B.A. from Columbia University. Since taking over as chairman of Lotte's Korean affiliates, which comprise the bulk of the group's assets, in 2011, he has become embroiled in a bitter feud with his older brother, Shin Dong-Joo, for control over the group.
