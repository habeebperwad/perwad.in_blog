			Septuagenarian David Duffield founded not just one, but two successful enterprise software companies after age 40. He mortgaged his home to bootstrap PeopleSoft, which he started when he was 47. In 2005, he sold the company to Oracle for $10.7 billion in cash.  At age 65, he founded Workday, which went public in 2012, and where  he serves as chairman. Duffield says he plans to leave the bulk of his fortune to his animal charity, Maddie's Fund--named after his beloved schnauzer--and other charitable causes, not to his 10 children. In May 2015, Duffield moved back to Lake Tahoe from the Bay Area and donated his Bay Area estate to Maddie's Fund. The property was listed for sale for $39 million in May 2016 and all proceeds will go to the animal charity.
