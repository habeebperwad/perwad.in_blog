Braun Melsungen AG in 1977 -- when the company had just $24 million in annual sales -- and turned it into one of the world's largest manufacturers of medical products.  Employing some 54,000 people globally and generating around $6.5 billion in annual revenue, the company has four divisions: Hospital Care, whose products include infusion and injection solutions; Aesculap, a manufacturer of surgical instruments and devices; OPM (outpatient market), which sells medical products to practitioners outside of the hospital market; and Avitum, a provider of dialysis and other technologies relating to blood treatment. Karl Friedrich owns 10% of the family company.
