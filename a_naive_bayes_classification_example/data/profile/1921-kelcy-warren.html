			Kelcy Warren cofounded pipeline company Energy Transfer with Ray C. Davis (now also a billionaire) in 1995. He has been CEO of Energy Transfer Partners since 2007. In November 2016, pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics Partners announced it would acquire Energy Transfer Partners for $20 billion in stock.  In January 2017, after almost a year of intense protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, President Trump signed an executive order to allow finalizing construction of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, which Energy Transfer Partners is building. The company says the 1,172-mile pipeline could transport 500,000 barrels of oil daily.  When he was young, Warren spent summers working with his dad as a welder's assistant on Sun Pipeline in Texas. He studied at U. of Texas, Arlington.  A music fan, Warren produces albums for singer-songwriters at his Austin, Texas studio, Music Road Records.
