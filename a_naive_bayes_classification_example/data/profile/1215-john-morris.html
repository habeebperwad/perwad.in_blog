			As a young man, John Morris looked around at the fishing tackle where he lived in Springfield, Missouri. He wanted something better. So he rented a U-Haul, traveled the country, stocked up on the top tackle, and then started selling lures from his dad's liquor store.  Three years later, Morris mailed the first catalog and later began selling motor boats and trailers at factory-direct prices, undercutting competitors. Eventually he created an outdoorsman's paradise: Bass Pro Shops, the chain of hunting-and-fishing megastores that reeled in an estimated $4.5 billion in sales in 2015. Morris is the majority owner and CEO. Bass Pro announced plans to acquire rival Cabela's in October 2016; the deal is awaiting regulatory and Cabela's shareholder approval.
