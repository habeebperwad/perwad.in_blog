			Nathan Blecharczyk is cofounder and chief technology officer of San Francisco-based Airbnb, which lists 2 million homes and rooms for rental stays in 190 countries. Some 60 million guests have used the service since it launched in 2008. In 2015 Blecharczyk helped oversee Airbnb's push into Cuba.  In September 2016, the company raised $555 million at a $30 billion valuation in a funding round that will reportedly total $850 million. That month Blecharczyk said the company would focus on expanding geographically, particularly in China, growing its business travel vertical and widening offerings beyond accommodations. He and his cofounders joined the Giving Pledge in June 2016, promising to give away at least half of their fortunes to philanthropic causes.
