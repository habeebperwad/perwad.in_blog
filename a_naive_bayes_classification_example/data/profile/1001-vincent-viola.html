			The son of a truck driver from Brooklyn, Vincent Viola started the electronic-trading firm Virtu Financial in 2008. He took the company public in April 2015, touting its can't-lose business model and the fact that it turned a profit on 1,484 of its first 1,485 days in operation.  In Michael Lewis' book Flash Boys, the author pointed to Virtu's winning streak as evidence of the huge informational advantage that high-frequency traders have over other investors. Viola graduated from West Point in 1977 and New York Law School in 1983. Donald Trump appointed him to be Secretary of the Army in December 2016, but Viola withdrew his nomination two months later. He owns the NHL's Florida Panthers.
