			Visiting the U.S. in the late 1980s, Torsten Toeller encountered pet supply superstores and decided the concept deserved a try in his native Germany. He opened his first Fressnapf store in 1990, in Erkelenz.  At first, customers were unimpressed with his selection and prices. So the entrepreneur doubled down -- selling his car to generate some quick cash, then investing in more inventory and going for broke with aggressive discounts. The gamble paid off, and in 1992 Fressnapf Tiernahrungs GmbH began opening franchise stores, paving the way for rapid growth. Today, with over 10,000 people working in approximately 1,400 stores in 12 countries, it's Europe's largest pet speciality chain. (Stores outside of Germany -- numbering over 450 and growing -- operate under the name Maxi Zoo.) The company emphasizes providing expert advice, so employees receive "continuous training and education" at its Fressnapf Academy. Fressnapf's newer stores carry as many as 10,000 different products; customers can choose from eleven private labels across a wide range of prices, including the "Moments" brand of premium cat food. Torsten Toeller owns 100% of the company, which is headquartered in Krefeld and generates over $1.9 billion in annual revenue.
