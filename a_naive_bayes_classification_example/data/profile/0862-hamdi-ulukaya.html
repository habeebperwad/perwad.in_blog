			Hamdi Ulukaya, the Turkish founder of America's most popular Greek yogurt, Chobani, came to the U.S in 1994 to study business. Seeing that yogurt wasn't as natural and nutritious as it was at home, Ulukaya created his own recipe and has since made a fortune from the nation's Greek yogurt craze.  He started by buying a Kraft Foods yogurt plant in central New York state with a loan from the Small Business Administration in 2005. Two years later his yogurt hit the shelves. The entrepreneur sold an estimated 20% stake to private equity firm TPG Capital in 2014. He owns the rest of the now $1.7 billion (2015 sales) business, despite efforts by his ex-wife to claim some of the firm. Outside of work, Ulukaya, who signed the Giving Pledge in 2015, has set up a nonprofit called the Tent Foundation to help refugees. He traveled to Greece and Germany in 2015 and met with refugees and entrepreneurs, seeking innovative approaches to help refugees. In the U.S, his company embraces hiring refugees and offers them English language classes along with translators in up to 11 languages.
