			Osman Kibar was born in Izmir, Turkey, on the Aegean Coast. While getting a PhD in biophotonics from the University of California, San Diego, he founded two companies, but did not have a management role in either.  He then founded Samumed in a Pfizer incubator, but had a falling out with the drug giant; Samumed now operates independent of Pfizer. The company is developing drugs involved in the WNT pathway, a collection of genes involved in aging and cancer. The lead two medicines are intended to treat osteoarthritis and baldness. Clinical trials are ongoing. Kibar's net worth is based on his stake in the private company. He met most of his fellow executives at Samumed in boarding school.
