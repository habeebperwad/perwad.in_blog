			Pharma distributor's son Satish Mehta founded and runs privately held Emcure Pharmaceuticals, which counts private equity firm Bain Capital as a key investor. He started the generics maker in Pune city as a contract manufacturer for multinationals in 1981. After more than a decade Mehta began marketing and distributing his own branded generics.  Today close to 60% of Emcure's revenue of $650 million is generated overseas, mainly in North America. The company's American subsidiary,  Heritage Pharmaceuticals, has been embroiled in a federal generic drug price fixing investigation. The wealth of the beleaguered tycoon, who isn't commenting on the case, is down on new information that he has fewer shares than previously estimated. Mehta's 2 U.S.-educated children, son-in-law and nephew work with him.
