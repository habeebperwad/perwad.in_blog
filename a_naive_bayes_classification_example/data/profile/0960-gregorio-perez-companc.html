			Gregorio Perez Companc built energy conglomerate Perez Companc and sold it to Brazilian energy giant Petrobas for $1 billion in 2002. In the past 10 years, Gregorio Perez Companc has been more focused on his health, family, philanthropy and passion for cars than on his diverse investments in energy, finance, construction, telecommunications, food and agriculture.   In December 2009, he stepped down from active involvement in business, and gave his 75% stake in food giant Molinos Rio de la Plata, a maker of pasta, flour and frozen vegetables, to his seven children. Gregorio Perez purchased 60% of Molinos Rio de la Plata from Bunge & Born in 1999 for $400 million. At his wife's urging, he launched ice cream parlor chain Munchi's. He also established the Bioparque Temaiken, a nature and wildlife preserve outside of Buenos Aires. He had eight children with his wife Maria del Carmen Sundblad Beccar Varela. He founded PÃ©rez Companc foundation after Margarita, his eldest daughter, died in a car accident in the 1980s.
