			Terry Gou is chairman of Hon Hai Precision, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer, whose top customers include Apple.  Better known by its trade name, Foxconn, Hon Hai employs more than a million people.  The company paid $3.5 billion for control of Japanese electronics maker Sharp in August 2016. It also purchased the Nokia mobile phone brand from Microsoft in December as part of a broader $350 million deal with the software titan. Gou founded the business in 1974 with $7,500 in his pocket and a belief that electronics products "would be an integral part of everyday life in every office and in every home."
