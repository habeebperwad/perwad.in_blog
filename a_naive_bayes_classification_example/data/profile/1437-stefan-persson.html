Stefan was CEO for 16 years until 1998. Son Karl-Johan, also a billionaire, is now in the top job. Two other children, Charlotte Söderström and Tom Persson, are billionaires, as is sister Lottie. Outside of H&M, Persson has been building a portfolio of first class retail property across Europe and the U.S. Through Ramsbury Property he owns real estate in some of the worlds's most glamorous shopping districts, spanning Fifth Ave in New York, Oxford Street in London, Via del Corso in Rome and the Champs-Elysée in Paris.
