			Thaksin Shinawatra , the former prime minister of Thailand, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai for the past decade, owns a controlling stake in property firm SC Asset, among much else. The ruling military junta recently sought to collect a capital gains tax on Thaksin's sale of telecom firm Shin Corp's  shares to Singapore's Temasek a decade ago.  Thaksin has become more vocal lately. Last April, during the Thai Songkran festival, he addressed a gathering of former members of his party in Bangkok via Skype, criticizing the government for its handling of the economy. In October, he delivered a lecture at California's Loyola Marymount University on reducing poverty.
