			Lia Maria Aguiar inherited a banking fortune from her late father, Amador Aguiar, the founder of Bradesco, one of Brazil's largest banks. She and her twin sister Lina and her sister Maria Angela were adopted by Aguiar after being abandoned in front of a Bradesco branch in Sao Paulo.  Amador Aguiar died in 1991. Amador founded the philanthropic Bradesco Foundation in 1956 to benefit education in Brazil. In 2008, Lia started her own foundation, the Lia Maria Aguiar Foundation, to benefit the city of Campos do Jordao, where she has been living since the early 1990s. The sisters also have shares of Bradespar, the bank's non-financial arm, which holds a majorstake in Vale SA, the world's largest iron-ore producer.
