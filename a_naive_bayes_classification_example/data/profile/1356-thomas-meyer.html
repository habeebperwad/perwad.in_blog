			Swiss born Thomas Meyer is CEO of Spanish retailer Desigual, which has more than 500 stores around the globe. He started the brand at age 25 in 1984 with a denim jacket created from a patchwork of worn blue jeans that he designed.  The first store opened in Ibiza in 1986. Meyer sold a 10% stake in his company to French investment firm Eurazeo for nearly $400 million in 2014, but took over as CEO in 2015 on the heels of tepid sales.
