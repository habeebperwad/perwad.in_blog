			Mori Arkin got his start in business in 1972 helping his father run a small Israeli pharmaceutical distribution company. As big drug companies began creating their own distribution arms, Arkin and his father moved into generics manufacturing, renaming the firm Agis Industries.  They ran it under that name for two decades and then sold it to American pharmaceutical company Perrigo for $818 million in cash and stock in 2004. Arkin still has a tiny stake (less than 1%) in Perrigo, and he's still bullish on the healthcare sector. He's invested in Israeli hedge fund Sphera Global Healthcare and sits on its investment committee, and he's also poured more than $100 million into 20 pharmaceutical and medical device companies, mostly based in Israel. He's also invested in real estate. Arkin's two sons are involved in the family business; his daughter is serving in the Israel Defense Forces. Arkin is an art history buff and enjoys composing music as a hobby. He and his wife, a sculptor, support art students with scholarships to an art center in Herziliya.
