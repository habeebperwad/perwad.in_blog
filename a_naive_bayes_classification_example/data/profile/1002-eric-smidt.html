			In 1977, Eric Smidt started Harbor Freight Tools as a teenager with his father. In the beginning, Harbor Freight was a small mail-order business that sold tools out of a small shop in North Hollywood. It eventually grew into a chain store with over 700 locations in 47 states.  Smidt became the president of the company in 1985 and then CEO in 1999. In 2010 he was sued by his father Allan for looting the company, using its leverage to allegedly buy a $20 million New York City condo, finance his Beverly Hills property "The Knoll" and buy a single painting worth $100 million. The suit was eventually settled out of court. Smidt is known for being a collector of art and a great philanthropist, donating tens of millions of dollars to numerous organizations including many in his hometown of Los Angeles. In October 2016 he gave $25 million to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
