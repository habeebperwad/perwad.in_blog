			Gudrun Heine's father founded Storz GmbH & Co. KG. in 1945, as a manufacturer of ENT (Ear, Nose & Throat) instruments, headlamps and binocular loupes. Fascinated with developing instruments that would enable physicians to look inside the body, and combining the meticulousness of the craftsman with the imaginative power of the artist and inventor, Karl Storz, who died in 1996, pioneered the principle of "cold light illumination" whereby bright light generated by an external source is introduced into the body through a flexible fiber-optic cable.  This innovation paved the way for modern endoscopy and laid the foundation for the company's future success. Today, with a portfolio of more than 15,000 products, Storz is a world leader in endoscopy instruments for human and veterinary medicine as well as industrial applications. With annual revenue of around $1.5 billion, Storz employs more than 6,700 people in 41 countries worldwide. Heine, who owns 44.5% of the company, serves as the president of the board of directors, while sister Sybill and nephew Karl-Christian manage day-to-day operations.
