			Alex Beard runs the worldwide oil operations at commodities trader and mining giant Glencore, where he has worked since 1995. Like his four fellow billionaire Glencore executives, Beard saw his net worth rise dramatically this year thanks to a 213% increase in the company's stock price.  He is based in London, and is the highest ranking Glencore executive in the UK. He was named director of Glencore's oil commodity department in 2007. A graduate of Oxford University with a degree in biochemistry, Beard first became a billionaire when Glencore listed on the London exchange in 2011. He owns an estimated 2% stake in Glencore, which has vast assets in oil and gas, agriculture and mining span the globe. Glencore completed a mega-merger in 2013 with Xstrata, then the fourth-largest mining conglomerate in the world. Glencore has since dropped Xstrata from its name entirely. Before joining Glencore, Beard spent five years as an oil trader at BP.
