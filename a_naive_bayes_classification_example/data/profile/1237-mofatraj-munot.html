			Mumbai real estate magnate Mofatraj Munot started property development in 1969 after working with his uncle. He snatched lucrative construction contracts in the Middle East during the 1970s oil boom where he built, among much else, the palace of the ruler of Sharjah.  Today, his Kalpataru, run by son Parag, is focusing on its 11.2-million-square-foot township in suburban Mumbai, which will be a mix of residences, offices and retail spaces. The privately held firm has also started work on 6 residential redevelopment projects. Engineering contractor Kalpataru Power Transmission, which is Munot's only listed asset, is flush with orders exceeding $1.2 billion.
