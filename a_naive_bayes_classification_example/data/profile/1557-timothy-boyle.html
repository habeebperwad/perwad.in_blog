			After his father died suddenly of a heart attack in 1970, Tim Boyle returned home from the University of Oregon to help his mother, Gert, rescue their fledgling family company, Columbia Sportswear. Tim ran operations at the outdoor retailer, while Gert dealt with the finances.  Revenues fell 25% to $600,000 in the first year, and the company's bankers told the Boyles to sell the business. One buyer came in and offered $1,400. "Three times its actual value," Tim told FORBES in 2015. Gert cussed out the would-be buyer and recommitted to building the business. Columbia sales eventually took off, thanks to clever marketing and innovative products, like the Bugaboo jacket, which included an interchangeable zip-in fleece liner. Columbia hauled in $2.4 billion in revenues in 2016. Nearly 50 years after Boyle came home from college, he is still the CEO.
