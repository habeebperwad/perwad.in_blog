			Beer industry veteran Walter Faria bought Grupo Petropolis in 1998 and transformed it into one of Brazil's largest beer-and-beverage companies. Faria had previously worked as a distributor for Schincariol, a Brazilian brewer that Japan's Kirin Holdings bought in 2011. Petropolis, which employs more than 26,000 people, makes Itaipava beer, Brazil's second-biggest seller.  Founded in Petrópolis, a mountainous region in the state of Rio de Janeiro, the Petrópolis Group is the second largest brewer in Brazil.
