			Georg Nemetschek is the founder and deputy chairman of Nemetschek Group, a provider of software for the architecture, engineering, construction and media industries. He started using design software in his own engineering office, which he had founded in 1963, in the late 1960s, long before computers became available for personal use.  In 1970 he was appointed professor for Civil Engineering Informatics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences and later served as dean of the Faculty for Civil Engineering from 1977 to 1996. Three years later, in 1999, Nemetschek Programmsysteme GmbH went public. Today, Nemetschek Group serves about 2.1 million users in 142 countries with its 14 brands and employs about 2,000 employees worldwide. Nemetschek and his wife and children own about 55% of the company. His son Ralf is also chairman of the family foundation Nemetschek Stiftung, founded in 2007 to strengthen democracy in Germany.
