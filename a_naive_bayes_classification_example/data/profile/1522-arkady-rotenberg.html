			Arkady Rotenberg is one of the most influential businessmen in Russia. He was judo sparring partner with President Vladimir Putin. An ice hockey fan, he apparently still plays with Putin and is chairman of the executive board of Russian Ice Hockey Federation.  The close ties with Putin made him and his brother targets of U.S. and European sanctions in 2014. The U.S. Treasury Department claimed that Putin had awarded the Rotenberg brothers billions of dollars in contracts with oil and gas giant Gazprom and for the Sochi winter Olympics. In September 2014, the Italian police seized millions in assets from Arkady including a luxury hotel in Rome and two villas in Sardinia. After the sanctions, Arkady transferred some assets to his son Igor, including stakes in drilling company Gazprom Bureniye, road construction company Mostotrest, and TPS Real Estate Holding. Arkady owns Stroygazmontazh Corporation (or SGM Group), one of Russia's biggest construction contractors in the energy field. SGM Group is also building Kerch Strait bridge between Russia and Crimea peninsula. Rotenberg also holds an 80% stake in nitric fertilizer manufacturer Minudobreniya, and has an indirect stake in Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow.
