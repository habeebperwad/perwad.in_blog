			Mario Gabelli is a life-long contrarian, a trait evident even as a schoolboy when he refused to hide with classmates during air raid drills. He bought his first stocks at 13. After a Fordham scholarship and Columbia MBA, he internalized the teachings of boss John Loeb that small companies were better than big ones.  His first money came from trading those unloved stocks. Then he founded Gamco in 1977. Gabelli's reputation took off in the 80s, particularly for his insights into media companies. These days the investor is also known for his unusual compensation agreement. Gabelli enjoys 10% of the firm's pretax profit and "variable compensation" instead of taking a salary, bonus or stock options. He was reportedly Wall Street's highest paid chief executive when he took home $85 million in 2013. In December 2015, he donated $10 million to Boston College, the alma mater of his four children.
