			Son-in-law of Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbaev, Timur Kulibaev has emerged as a key player in Gazprom's deal with China; he has been on the board of the Russian energy giant since 2009 and has also held several high-level positions in Kazakhstan's oil and gas sector.  An investment in mobile telecom service paid off handsomely in 2004, when a company he controlled sold Kar-Tel, operating in Kazakhstan, to VimpleCom for $350 million. In 2014, he sold his Altynalmas Gold to Polymetal, part-owned by Russian billionaire Alexander Nesis, for cash and company shares. He also owns a majority stake in Halyk Savings Bank (book value: $1.8 billion) with his wife, Dinara. Kulibaev is President of the Kazakhstan Boxing Federation and Chairman of Presidium of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs.
