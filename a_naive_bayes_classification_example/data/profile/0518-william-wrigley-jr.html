			The heir to Wrigley's chewing gum fortune, William Wrigley took over the family's century-old business in 1999, then expanded the company by purchasing Altoids and Life Savers from Kraft Foods. He sold the Chicago-based firm to candy giant Mars Inc.  for $23 billion in 2008. A scuba-diving enthusiast, Wrigley has spent much of his time managing his family's investments and promoting marine conservation in recent years. His great-grandfather started the candy business in 1891. After originally selling baking soda, the Wrigley founder changed strategies when he realized the chewing gum he was giving away for free was more popular than the baking soda. Bill Wrigley's grandfather P.K. Wrigley owned the Chicago Cubs, but the family had to sell baseball's lovable losers in 1981 in order to afford estate taxes after his death.
