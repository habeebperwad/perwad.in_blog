			Alain Bouchard founded convenience store conglomerate Alimentation Couche-Tard with a single Quebec store in 1980. He served as president and CEO until September 2014, growing the business by snatching up competitors, including the Circle K convenience store chain in 2003 and Scandinavian fuel and retail giant Statoil in 2012. In February 2016 Couche-Tard acquired Topaz Energy Group, which owned 444 gas and convenience stations in Ireland.  As executive chairman Bouchard still oversees the $34 billion (sales) company, which more than 12,000 owned or franchised stores worldwide. He got his start stocking shelves at his brother's franchised Perrette store in Bois-des-Filion, Quebec before moving on to another Quebec operator, Provi-Soir, and eventually setting out on his own.
