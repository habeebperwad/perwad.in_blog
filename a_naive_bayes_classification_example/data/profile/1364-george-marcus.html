			San Francisco Bay Area real estate broker George Marcus has been in the business since 1971, joining forces with partner William Millichap for most of those years. Most of Marcus's fortune stems from a 54% stake in Marcus & Millichap, a public real estate brokerage that closed more than 8,700 investment transactions valued at $37.8 billion in 2015. The brokerage specializes in transactions with private clients valued at less than $10 million.  Marcus also controls a 2.4% stake in Essex Property Trust, a REIT he founded that owns 59,000 apartments along the West Coast. Marcus also has a stake in several private real-estate and investment companies, including SummerHill Housing Group and Pacific Urban Residential. Previously, Marcus was a director of Plaza Commerce Bank and Greater Bay Bancorp, which sold to Wells Fargo in 2007. He was reportedly born on a Greek island and immigrated to the United States when he was four. He graduated with a B.A. in economics from San Francisco State University and served on the Board of Regents of the University of California from 2000 to 2012.
