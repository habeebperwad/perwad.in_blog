			Mikhail Gutseriev is the majority shareholder of Safmar Group (former name BIN Group), a diversified conglomerate. His brother, Sait-Salam Gutseriev, and nephew, Mikail Shishkhanov -- also billionaires -- own the rest.  Safmar Group own the oil giants Russneft and Neftisa. In 2016 Russneft went public via IPO. Safmar Group got $500 million on that deal. In recent years, he's taken advantage of Russia's economic crisis to build up his portfolio. In 2015, he spent $1.5 billion acquiring banks, pension funds, oil fields, factories, real estate development companies, warehouses and a popular Russian radio station, Radio Shanson.  Earlier, he'd bought Multinational Logistics Partnership from billionaire Victor Vekselberg and two five-star hotels in central Moscow from Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire former prime minister of Georgia. He also bought Moscow's famous National Hotel from billionaire Elena Baturina, Russia's richest woman. In late 2006 he was accused of violating terms of his oil license and failing to pay taxes. After denying the charges, he sold Russneft to billionaire Oleg Deripaska for $2.8 billion and moved to London. When the charges were dropped in 2010, Gutseriev returned to Russia and bought back Russneft. Gutseriev writes lyrics for songs performed by famous Russian singers.
