			Indian property tycoon Niranjan Hiranandani cofounded Hiranandani Group with brother Surendra who now owns his independent venture. The brothers still own some assets jointly, mainly the Powai township in suburban Mumbai, which they built on a former quarry.  In what was billed as India's largest commercial real estate deal, they sold their commercial and retail assets in Powai to Canda's Brookfield Asset Management for $1 billion. Through his family office Nidar Group, Hiranandani is investing in energy infrastructure, building natural gas pipelines and two gas storage terminals. Upcoming projects overseas include a budget hotel in Dubai to be managed by Accor under the Ibis Styles brand.
