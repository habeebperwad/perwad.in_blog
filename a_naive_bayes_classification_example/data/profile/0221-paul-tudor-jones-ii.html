			Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II is known for his macro trades, particularly his bets on interest rates and currencies. In 1980, he founded Tudor Investment Corporation and it has posted a stellar record since inception, delivering double digit annualized returns.  In recent years, however, returns have not been inspiring and the firm has suffered some redemptions. Jones has responded by laying off employees, cutting some fees, and refocusing by incorporating some quantitative methods. A graduate of the University of Virginia, Jones' donations have helped finance a new basketball arena and various research facilities. He also founded Robin Hood Foundation to fight poverty in New York.
