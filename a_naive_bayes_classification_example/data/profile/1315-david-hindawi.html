			David Hindawi cofounded cybersecurity firm Tanium with his son Orion in 2007. The duo previously started BigFix, an IT software patching system that they sold to IBM for $400 million in 2010. By then, the Hindawis already had moved on to Tanium, building the software in secret for five years before unveiling a new, super-fast way to scan and control security across thousands of networked computers in a company.  In September 2015, they raised $120 million in new funding that valued Tanium at $3.5 billion, doubling their valuation of five months prior. In February 2016, Orion took over as CEO from his father, but in practice they co-manage Tanium. David is an immigrant who was born in Baghdad, grew up in Israel, and went to UC Berkeley to earn a PhD.
