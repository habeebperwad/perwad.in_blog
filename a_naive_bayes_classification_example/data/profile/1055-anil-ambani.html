			Younger Ambani sibling Anil Ambani orchestrated the merger of his Reliance Communication's telecom business with that of rival Aircel, controlled by Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan. The combine, which awaits regulatory approvals, will be the country's fourth-largest mobile phone operator.  He's also betting heavily on the defence sector; his Reliance Defence has inked several joint ventures of late including with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and France's Dassault Aviation. Son Anmol, who works at Reliance Capital, was appointed to that company's board last August.
