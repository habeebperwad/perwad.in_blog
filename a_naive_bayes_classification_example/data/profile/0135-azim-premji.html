			Tech magnate Azim Premji's $7.7 billion (revenue) Wipro, India's third-largest outsourcer, has been on a buying spree to boost growth. Its most recent acquisition was Appirio, a cloud consulting firm based in Indianapolis, for $500 million.  Wipro started in 1945 as Western Indian Vegetable Products to make cooking oil from peanuts. Premji abandoned his studies to look after the family business in 1966 when his father Mohamed Hasham Premji died. He added new products such as soaps to the company's portfolio, but a timely expansion into software brought him riches. Last year Premji completed 5 decades as Wipro's boss.
