			Emanuella Barilla is a fourth-generation heir to the Barilla pasta fortune, which she shares with her three billionaire brothers, Guido, Paolo and Luca. Barilla is the largest pasta company in the world, with an estimated $3.7 billion in annual revenues, and operations in the U. S., France, Russia, Turkey, Mexico and Greece. Emanuella currently serves as a director of Barilla Holdings. Founded in 1877 in Parma, Italy, Barilla operated under three generations of family leaders before selling to American firm W.R. Grace in 1971. Eight years later, Pietro Barilla, Emanuella's father, bought the company back. Pietro's four children now equally split the family fortune.
