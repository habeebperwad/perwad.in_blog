			Dubbed the "Queen of Las Vegas," Elaine Wynn cofounded Wynn Resorts with ex-husband Steve Wynn (whom she divorced twice) in 2002. She served on the company's board for more than 12 years until she was ousted in April 2015 after a bitter proxy battle.  She's still locked in a legal fight with Steve over her ability to sell her 9% stake in Wynn Resorts. She is president of the Nevada State Board of Education and a board member of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She also serves as cochair of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to which she pledged $50 million in April 2016 toward the construction of a new home for the museum's permanent collection. She purchased Francis Bacon's "Three Studies of Lucian Freud" triptych in 2013 for $142.4 million, then a record-high price for a work of art.
