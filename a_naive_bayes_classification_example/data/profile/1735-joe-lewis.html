			Joe Lewis continues to expand his vision for his Lake Nona development near Orlando, one of the fastest growing communities in the USA. In January 2017, the U.S. Tennis Association opened its new $63 million campus, with 100 courts and a dormitory, on the site.  That same month accounting firm KPMG announced a new $430 million training and conference center to be built at Lake Nona. Major League Soccer's Orlando City SC is building a new 23-acre training facility at Lake Nona, set to be complete in 2018. His Tavistock investment firm paid $165 million in December 2016 for the Hyatt Regency Pier Sixty-Six in Fort Lauderdale.  Lewis also owns London Premiere League soccer team Tottenham Hotspur and has a stake in UK's largest pub operator, Mitchell's & Butlers plc, and a variety of other investments including luxury club resort Albany, restaurants, hotels, and even an Australian agriculture firm.
