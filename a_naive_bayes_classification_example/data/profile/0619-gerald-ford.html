			Gerald Ford is a shrewd banker, snapping up distressed banks, turning them around and selling them for a profit. He bought his first bank in 1975 and scored big in 2002 when, along with his billionaire buddy Ronald Perelman, he sold California's Golden State Bancorp to Citigroup for $6 billion in stock.  Ford has also invested in office buildings in Charlotte, Denver and Nashville, shopping centers in Dallas and apartments in Houston. In 2013, he committed $15 million to Southern Methodist University, his alma mater. That was on top of $20 million he'd given in 1997 to fund the construction of a new football stadium. Ford and his wife, Kelli, have homes in Dallas and the Hamptons plus a ranch in New Mexico.
