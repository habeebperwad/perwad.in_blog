			Thomas Bailey's fortune comes from mutual fund giant Janus, which he founded in Denver in 1969. The firm had exceptional returns during the bull markets of the 1980s and 1990s. But in the early 2000s losses started mounting, and in 2002 he resigned as CEO.  Two years later he stepped down as chairman and sold his stake in the firm for $1.2 billion (before taxes). A Michigan State graduate who worked on Wall Street before moving to Denver, he spends his time fly-fishing and breeding horses.
