			Julio Bozano made a fortune in banking and used some of it to back low-cost Brazilian airline, Azul Linhas Aereas, launched by JetBlue founder David Neeleman. In 2015 both United Airlines and China's HNA Group acquired separate stakes in Azul, giving the Brazilian airline a valuation of more than $1.7 billion.  In 2000, he sold his Brazilian bank, Banco Bozano & Simonsen, to Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano for a reported $550 million. In early 2013, Bozano acquired stakes in Brazilian asset management firms Mercatto Investimentos, BR Investimentos, and Trapezus Asset Management and merged them into Bozano Investimentos, now one of Brazil's largest private equity firms with over with $1.1 billion under management. Backed by European media conglomerate Bertelsmann, Bozano Investimentos raised $309 million in 2015 to launch a private equity fund focused on the education sector in Brazil. In 2016, Equity International (EI), owned by American Billionaire Sam Zell, invested over $100 million in Brazil's largest parking operator Estapar, one of the 33 companies of Bozano Investimentos portfolio. A thoroughbred horse owner, Bozano owns more than 300 mares in farms around the world. He is also an art collector and owns more than 100 paintings by artists including Picasso and contemporary Brazilian painter Beatriz Milhares. He reportedly splits his time between his farm in Greenwich, Connecticut and Rio de Janeiro.
