			The Czech Republic's richest man, Petr Kellner got his start in the early 1990's selling office supplies. He borrowed $1 million against that business and started an investment fund which he used to buy a controlling stake in the biggest Czech insurer during its privatization.  Kellner's PFF group is a significant shareholder in Home Credit, a consumer finance firm with operations in the Czech Republic and 10 other countries, including China and Russia. In 2015, Home Credit formed a venture with mobile phone carrier Sprint in the U.S. to provide financing for purchasing mobile phones. Some of Kellner's other assets include a stake in listed telecom firm O2 Czech Republic; PPF Bank; commercial real estate holdings and a stake in London-listed gold and silver miner Polymetal. Kellner, with his wife, endows scholarships at his Open Gate School, collects modern Czech photography and is the leading sponsor of a library-think-tank for Czech ex-President Vaclav Klaus.
