			Miuccia Prada is the co-CEO and lead designer of the handbag and fashion empire Prada, in which she has a 28% stake. In 1977 Miuccia and her siblings Albert and Marina inherited the family fashion business, founded in 1913 by their grandfather.  Miuccia met Patrizio Bertelli, who ran a luxury leather company, at a Milan trade show in 1977 and signed him on as a contractor. A year later, they were married and Bertelli joined the company, taking care of the business side of things while pushing Prada into new directions. He serves as co-CEO with Miuccia, and his stake in the company also makes him a billionaire. In 1986 Prada opened its first store in New York and expanded beyond high-end suitcases, handbags, and steamer trunks. A few years later, the company unveiled a ready-to-wear women's collection and a second brand, Miu Miu. Miuccia, who has a Ph.D in political science from the University of Milan, took the company public with Bertelli in Hong Kong in 2011.
