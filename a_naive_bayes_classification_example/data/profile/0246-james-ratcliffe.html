			Former engineer James Ratcliffe is the founder, chairman and majority owner of chemical powerhouse Ineos Group, which produces everything from synthetic oils and plastics to solvents used to produce insulin and antibiotics.  The Manchester native has ambitions to make Ineos U.K's largest player in shale gas, with production fields in the North Sea that supplies 1 in 10 of the nation's homes with gas. Ineos also has access to over one million acres of shale exploration areas in England and Scotland, and after moving its headquarters to Switzerland to save on taxes in 2010, the company returned to make London its home base in late 2016.  An adventure seeker, Ratcliffe has made trips to both the North and South poles, and went on a month-long motorbike trip in South Africa in 2015.
