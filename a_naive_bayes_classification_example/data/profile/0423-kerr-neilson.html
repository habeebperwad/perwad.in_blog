Known for his value-based contrarian stock picks that have earned him comparisons with Warren Buffett, Neilson launched a new listed Asian investment fund in 2015 and recently had 25% of Platinum funds invested in Chinese companies.  The Johannesburg native bought his first stock at age 13. He cofounded international equities fund manager Platinum Asset Management in 1994, after moving to Sydney from South Africa a decade earlier to work for Bankers Trust Australia. His ex-wife, Judith, is also now a billionaire.
