			Born to poor farmers in an Italian village near Modena, Luigi Cremonini started a small butcher shop in 1963. Through his Cremonini Group, the meat king now supplies food to places like McDonald's in Italy, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Cyprus and Russia.  Its meat production division, one of three subsidiaries, makes more hamburgers than anyone else in Italy and gets half of its revenue from outside of Italy. Another subsidiary, publicly traded Marr, is Italy's largest food-service distributor, and sells food on English Eurostar trains, Belgium's Thalys service and on trains in Turkey and Russia. The Cremonini Group has $3.6 billion in annual revenue.
