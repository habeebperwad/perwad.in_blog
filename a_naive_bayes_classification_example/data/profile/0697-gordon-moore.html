			Gordon Moore is considered one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley. He cofounded Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957, then left with several others to launch Intel in 1968. He spent more than a decade as CEO at the chipmaker, then another decade as chairman before retiring in 1997. He is well known for his 1965 prediction that computer processing power would continue to dramatically increase and that relative costs would decline - an insight known as "Moore's Law.  " He and his wife, Betty, are known for their philanthropy. Their eponymous foundation, launched in 2000, had more than $6 billion in assets and had paid out more than $3.1 billion in grants by the end of 2015. The funds go to environmental conservation, patient care, scientific research and projects in the San Francisco Bay Area. "[We] don't want the foundation to just support good intentions," the Moores wrote in 2015. "Scientific methodology should be a cornerstone." In July 2015, they pledged $100 million to fund an endowment for graduate fellowships at the California Institute of Technology, where Moore earned a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1954.
