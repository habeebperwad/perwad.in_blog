			Kuan Kam Hon's Hartalega Holdings, founded in 1988, is the world's largest and fastest maker of nitrile gloves, which it exports to 40 countries. He started in 1969 at his father's company building high-end homes around Kuala Lumpur.  He set off on his own in 1978 and started a manufacturing business. As the AIDS epidemic hit he moved into rubber and then synthetic gloves for the medical industry. Nitrile gloves are made of material that is more puncture-resistant than rubber or latex gloves. Kuan plays mentor and spokesman, leaving operations to his two sons.
