			Richard Kinder chairs oil and gas pipeline giant Kinder Morgan, which has been buffeted by depressed oil prices and burdened by a high debt load. In July 2016, Kinder Morgan agreed to sell a stake in a 7,600-mile natural-gas pipeline system to utility Southern Co.  for $1.47 billion. In late 2015, Kinder Morgan reduced its dividend by 75%. It is still the largest U.S. energy infrastructure company, with an interest in 84,000 miles of pipeline. Richard Kinder cofounded Kinder Morgan in 1997 after stepping down as president of energy and commodities firm Enron Corp., four years before Enron's accounting fraud was unveiled and the firm shut down. He ended his Kinder Morgan CEO tenure with a bang, consolidating its oil-and-gas holdings in 2014 in a $70 billion deal, acquiring El Paso Pipeline Partners, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Kinder Morgan Management. It was the second-largest energy transaction in history, behind the 1999 Exxon-Mobil merger. Kinder stepped down as CEO in June 2015. His Kinder Foundation funds education, art and quality of life initiatives in Houston. In October 2015 he donated $25 million to University of Missouri to support studies of the U.S. constitution.
