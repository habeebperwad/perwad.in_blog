			The buoyant Sydney market continues to drive up Harry Triguboff's fortune. His apartment-tower development company, Meriton, sees strong demand in Australia's largest city, while it also has a presence in southeast Queensland.  Born in China to Russian parents, he came to Australia as a teenager. He began his working life in the textile business, making his move into real estate in the early 1960s. He built his first apartment block in the Sydney suburb of Gladesville. One of the first Australian developers to see the potential of apartment living at a time when most of his countrymen aspired to single-family homes in suburbia, he has put up more than 65,000 apartments, earning him the nickname "High Rise Harry." Triguboff established a center in Israel that focuses on immigrants and Judaism.
