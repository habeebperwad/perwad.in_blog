			Bernard Marcus was born to immigrant parents who came from Russia seeking the "golden land" in the U.S. and ended up in a fourth floor walk-up tenement in Newark, N.J. Marcus wanted to be a doctor but couldn't afford Harvard Medical School, so he instead studied pharmaceuticals at Rutgers.  He was fired from hardware store Handy Dan in 1978, along with his coworker Arthur Blank, so the duo started a rival retailer, Home Depot. In the early days no one came into the store, so Marcus and Blank sent their kids out into the streets to hand $1 bills to anyone willing to walk inside. In 1981, Marcus, Blank and early investor Kenneth Langone took Home Depot public. All three men are now billionaires.
