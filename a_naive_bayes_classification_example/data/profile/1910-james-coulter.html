			James Coulter met his longtime business partner David Bonderman while working for billionaire Robert Bass. The pair left in 1992 to found Texas buyout firm TPG Capital. Their first big deal: They invested $66 million in faltering Continental Airlines and ultimately made a $640 million profit.  Together the 2 are still principal owners of TPG, which had $74 billion in assets as of early 2017, though Bonderman operates from Texas and Coulter from San Francisco. Coulter helped form a group to study how digital technology can improve schools.
