			Glenn Dubin made a fortune in hedge funds after co-founding Highbridge Capital Management in 1992. He quietly exited his chairmanship at the end of 2014, after stepping down as CEO in 2013. He no longer has an equity stake in the firm, which J. P. Morgan Chase began buying up in 2004. He has since opened his family office, Dubin and Company, and has been focusing on leading Castleton Commodities, the energy firm he bought with an investor group that included Paul Tudor Jones in 2012. He also formed Engineers Gate, a quantitative hedge fund firm. Dubin is a founding board member of the Robin Hood Foundation, a New York poverty-fighting group. He's also a contributor to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where he supports breast cancer research.
