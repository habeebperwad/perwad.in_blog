			Megadealer David Nahmad and his brother Ezra own a huge stockpile of modern and impressionist art that they store in a duty-free warehouse next to the airport in Geneva, Switzerland. Their inventory includes work by more than 30 blue chip artists, from Monet and Matisse to Renoir and Rothko.  They buy and sell most of their works at auction. Among the holdings: 300 Picassos, worth at least $1 billion. The whole collection is worth some $3 billion. The brothers hold the art assets jointly, split 50/50. David also trades a currency and stock portfolio worth an estimated $350 million. David's son Hillel, known as Helly, runs the Helly Nahmad Gallery in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. His cousin, Ezra's son, is also named Helly and runs a gallery by the same name in London. David's younger son Joe runs the Nahmad Contemporary gallery on Manhattan's Madison Avenue. The sons' assets are separate from their fathers'.
