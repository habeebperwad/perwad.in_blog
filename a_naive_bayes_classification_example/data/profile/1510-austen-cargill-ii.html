			Austen Cargill II is one of 14 billionaire heirs to Cargill, the family business where he served as a vice president until retiring in 2001. Austen earned a Ph.D., then returned to work as a marine biologist for the company his great-grandfather W. W. Cargill founded in 1865. Back then the business was nothing more than one grain warehouse in small-town Iowa. Today it is the largest private company in the United States, with $107 billion in revenues in 2016. The behemoth sells food, processes crops, trades commodities, sources ingredients and offers financial risk management. The extended Cargill-MacMillan family is no longer active in management, but it still owns roughly 90% of the company. Six family members sit on its 17-person board of directors.
