			Iranian-British businessman and investor Farhad Moshiri bought a nearly 50% stake in British soccer club Everton in February 2016. To do the deal, the London resident sold his smaller stake in its soccer rival Arsenal to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, his partner in many deals and investments.  An accountant by training, Moshiri once worked for such firms as Ernst & Young and Deloitte Touche. After meeting Usmanov in the early 90's, he became his minority partner in several projects. Alongside Usmanov, he has stakes in Russian mining and steel manufacturing giant Metalloinvest and Russian wireless operator Megafon.
