			Andreas "Andy" von Bechtolsheim is cofounder, chairman and chief development officer of network switching company Arista Networks. He owes most of his fortune to an early $100,000 investment in Google and has earmarked his nearly 20% stake in Arista for his heirs.  In an unusual move, shortly before Arista's IPO in 2014, Arista cofounder David Cheriton's firm OptumSoft sued Arista, accusing it of violating the terms of a licensing agreement. A judge rejected those claims in December 2015. A second phase of the suit, regarding OptumSoft's claims that Arista misappropriated trade secrets, is ongoing. Arista is also battling litigation from its bigger rival, Cisco Systems, over copyright and patent infringement allegations. Arista denies all the allegations. Born in Germany, Von Bechtolsheim studied computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania and landed at Stanford University for his Ph.D. In 1982 he cofounded technology hardware firm Sun Microsystems; it was acquired by Oracle in 2010. Besides Arista, Bechtolsheim cofounded two other IT networking companies with Cheriton (one sold to Sun Microsystems, another to Cisco) and is an angel investor in Silicon Valley.
