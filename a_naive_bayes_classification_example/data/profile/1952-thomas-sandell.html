			Hedge fund billionaire, turned activist investor, Thomas Sandell runs Sandell Asset Management, which he founded in 1998. Hit hard by the great recession, the credit market specialist has built up his fortune twice.  Since 2013, Sandell has shifted tactics and engaged in loud proxy battles with firms like Bob Evans Farms and British transport group FirstGroup. A former badminton champion in his native Sweden, Sandell eventually earned an MBA from Columbia University and in 1988 landed a spot at Bear Stearns, where he worked with famed investment banker Ace Greenberg on such deals as Kirk Kerkorian's attempted buyout of Chrysler.
