			Randy Lerner is the former owner of the Cleveland Browns and the English Premier League's Aston Villa Football Club. His father, Al (d. 2002), worked as a furniture salesman, invested his earnings in Cleveland-area real estate, and then made a fortune in finance.  Al bought control of Equitable Bancorp in 1981, merged it with Maryland National in 1989, and spun off credit card giant MBNA in 1991. After his death, the family combined MBNA with Bank of America to create a $35 billion credit card and banking behemoth. In 1998, the Lerners bought the Cleveland Browns for $530 million before selling for nearly twice as much in August 2012. Randy Lerner's investment in Aston Villa, however, was considerably less successful - costing him hundreds of millions of dollars by the time of the club's sale in 2016.
