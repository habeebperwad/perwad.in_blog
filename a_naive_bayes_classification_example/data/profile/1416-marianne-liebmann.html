			Marianne Liebmann is one of 14 billionaire heirs to global food giant Cargill. She and her brothers Austen Cargill II and James Cargill II each own an estimated 7% of the company their great-grandfather founded in 1865. The son of a Scottish sea captain, W. W. Cargill started with just one grain storage warehouse at the end of an Iowa railroad line. W.W. got rich as the agricultural and rail industries spread west following the Civil War. He passed the business down to his son-in-law, John MacMillan, in 1909. The Cargill and MacMillan families still own roughly 90% of the company. Cargill took in $107 billion in revenues in 2016 selling food, processing crops, trading commodities, sourcing ingredients and offering financial risk management.
