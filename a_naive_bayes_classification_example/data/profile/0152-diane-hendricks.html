			"People would say, 'They're a flash in a pan, they'll be gone tomorrow," Diane Hendricks recalls of ABC Supply's early days.  She and her husband, Kenneth, founded the roofing company in 1982 and struggled to find backers who believed in their vision of creating a national, one-stop-shop chain for roofing supplies.  The distributor grew rapidly, fueled by a string of acquisitions. When Ken died in a roofing accident at their home in 2007, Diane soldiered on and rejected offers of buyouts, weathering the storm of the financial crisis before buying rival Bradco Supply in 2010. Sales of the Beloit, Wis., company have more than doubled in the past decade to nearly $6 billion from over 600 stores in 2015. The daughter of dairy farmers, Hendricks was named to Donald Trump's economic advisory team in August 2016.
