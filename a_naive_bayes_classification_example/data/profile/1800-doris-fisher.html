			With her husband Donald (d. 2009), Doris Fisher cofounded clothing chain Gap in 1969 after the couple couldn't find a pair of jeans that fit him. They raised $63,000 to open their first store, which sold jeans and music in San Francisco.  Don wanted to call the retailer "Pants and Discs," but instead Doris came up with "Gap" -- shorthand for the term 'generation gap.' She was the company's merchandiser until 2003 and served on its board until 2009. A noted art devotee, Doris loaned the collection she and her husband spent their lives collecting -- consisting of 1,100 works by 185 artists, including Andy Warhol, Ellsworth Kelly, and Richard Serra -- to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which, with her support, is now the largest modern art museum in the U.S.
