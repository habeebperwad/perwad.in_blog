It has notched up 100 million subscribers to date by offering free broadband and voice services. The $44.7 billion (revenue) Reliance Industries is locked in a legal battle with the government related to the recovery of costs associated with developing a gas field. Wife Nita, who sits on Reliance's board, is a member of the International Olympic Committee. (Reliance owns Network18, a licensee of Forbes Media.)
