			Since selling off his stakes in two industrial companies in 2013 and 2014, Israeli industrial titan Stef Wertheimer has continued to focus on his goal of creating lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian territories through building industrial parks in disadvantaged and predominantly Arab regions of Israel.  Wertheimer led his family to sell its 51% stake in Blades Technology in 2014. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway paid $2.05 billion for 20% of Wertheimer's metal-cutting company Iscar in 2013. Berkshire Hathaway had previously paid $4 billion for 80% of the company in 2006. Wertheimer built his first industrial park, or "capitalist kibbutz," thirty years ago. He's now spent over $100 million to build six of these Arab workplaces around Israel. He was honored with the Oslo Business for Peace Award in 2010 for these efforts.
