			Suhail Bahwan started out as a trader sailing a dhow he inherited from his father, and plied the waters between Oman and India. He never turned much of a profit, so in 1965 he moved from his small coastal village of Sur to Muscat, opening a shop in the souq.  He sold fishing nets, boating accessories and building materials, before scoring his first license in 1968 with Seiko, followed by Toshiba. He and his late brother Saud became Toyota's distributors in Oman in 1975, but split nearly 30 years later, with Saud keeping the dealership. (Saud's son Mohammed is also a billionaire.) Suhail's daughter Amal now helps run the Suhail Bahwan Group, which is the biggest privately-owned business in Oman, with interests in fertilizers, healthcare and construction.
