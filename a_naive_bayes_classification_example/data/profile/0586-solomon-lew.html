			Solomon Lew's Melbourne-based fashion house, Premier Investments continues to bolster his fortune despite industry headwinds. The group's Smiggle stationery stores, aimed at children and teenagers, are expanding rapidly in the U. K. following success in the local market. He became the first Australian to enter the World Retail Hall of Fame, in 2016, when he was inducted along with Jo Malone and Tommy Hilfiger. Lew says he always had an entrepreneurial mindset, working in retail after school and during holidays before opening his first apparel business on his 18th birthday.
