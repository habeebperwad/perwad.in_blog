			Wolfgang Marguerre founded Octapharma in Switzerland in 1983 and turned it into one of the world's largest manufacturers of blood plasma products. Developing and producing medicines derived from human proteins, it has production plants in six countries, more than 6,200 employees in 32 countries and annual revenue of over $1.6 billion.  Marguerre owns 100% of the company -- the "octa" in its name is taken from the Greek word for eight, the factor deficient in people with hemophilia A -- and channels most of the profits into research and development and expanding production capacity.  Octapharma is a leading corporate sponsor of Save One Life, an international nonprofit that supports children and adults with blood disorders. Marguerre personally donated $17.5 million to renovate Theater Heidelberg in 2008 and $1.13 million to the city of Heidelberg in 2015 to accept and integrate refugees. Two of his three children are in company management -- Frederic, as the shareholders' representative and president of Octapharma Plasma Inc. USA; and Tobias, as managing director of Octapharma Nordic AB. In the U.S., which is the largest and most profitable blood plasma market, Octapharma operates more than 45 donation centers and has built a new facility in Charlotte, NC. The company received criticism in 2015, after it became public that in 2013 it paid a consultant fee to the former Portuguese prime minister, José Sócrates, who is under the suspicion of corruption, money laundering and tax fraud.
