			The end of an era came in early 2017 when the Bass brothers agreed to sell their oil company to Exxon Mobil for $6 billion. Sid negotiated the deal directly with CEO Rex Tillerson. Origin of the fortune was their uncle Sid Richardson, a legendary wildcatter.  Over four decades they've expanded the wealth via smart investments made by former employees including Richard Rainwater (d. 2015) and David Bonderman. Sid has been laying low since his 2011 divorce from super-socialite wife Mercedes. In 2015 Sid reportedly bought actor Patrick Dempsey's estate in Malibu for $15 million. He rescued Texas ice cream maker Blue Bell with a $125 million loan after a 2015 listeria outbreak halted production for months.
