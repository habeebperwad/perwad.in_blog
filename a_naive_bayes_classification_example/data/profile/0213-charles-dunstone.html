			Charles Dunstone is chairman of TalkTalk Telecom and electronics retailer Dixons Carphone, both based in the UK; he is founder of the former and the Carphone component of the latter. In August 2014 Dunstone merged what was then Carphone Warehouse with Dixons in what was seen as a bet on the growth of the Internet of Things, a term for the increasing web-connectivity of home appliances and electronics.  He had first started Carphone in his London apartment in 1989 with $12,000 in savings. Talk Talk, which was later spun off from Carphone Warehouse, now represents the bulk of Dunstone's fortune. Outside of the office, he is an avid yachtsman and participates in sailing regattas around the globe.
