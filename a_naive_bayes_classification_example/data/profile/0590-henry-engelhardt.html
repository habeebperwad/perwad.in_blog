			The son of a Chicago meat-packer, Henry Engelhardt aspired to be a journalist before turning to entrepreneurship. He started insurance company Admiral Group in 1993. The Welsh company offers car and home insurance in the U. K. and was behind the country's first online insurance price comparison website. Based in Cardiff, U.K., Admiral also has operations in Spain, France, Italy, and the U.S. Its American brands include Elephant Auto Insurance and Comparenow.com. Admiral is known for its lighthearted, employee-friendly culture; its Ministry of Fun organizes events for all staff members, such as dress-up days, rock band contests and surfing trips. Engelhardt stepped down as CEO in May 2016, but said he will still be involved in the company in some capacity. He and his wife, Diane, started Moondance Foundation, and have donated 6.5 million Admiral shares in the last 4 years.
