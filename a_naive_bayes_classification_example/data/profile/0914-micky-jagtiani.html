			Middle East retail magnate Micky Jagtiani drove a taxi in London before moving to Bahrain and starting a baby products shop in 1973. He built it into the Dubai-headquarted Landmark Group, which his wife Renuka helps him run.  With estimated annual revenue of $6 billion, Landmark has more than 2,200 stores spread across the Middle East, Africa and India. Landmark plans to open new stores in Abu Dhabi's upcoming Reem Mall and also in Oman's Muscat Grand Mall. Landmark suspended sales of all Trump-branded products in its stores after the U.S. president made anti-Muslim remarks during his election campaign.
