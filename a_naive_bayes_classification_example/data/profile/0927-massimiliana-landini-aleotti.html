			Massimiliana Landini Aleotti and her three children inherited pharmaceutical giant Menarini from her late husband, Alberto Aleotti, who passed away in May 2014 at age 91. Alberto built Menarini into one of Italy's leading drug companies, with 14 manufacturing sites around the world and more than 16,000 employees.  Revenues in 2016 were $3.4 billion. Alberto Aleotti began working at Menarini in 1964, and bought Menarini from its owners in the early 1990s. In 1992, his eldest daughter Lucia joined the company. As his health deteriorated in 2011, Aleotti handed over the reins of his empire to Lucia, who became chairman, and his son Alberto Giovanni, who became vice chairman. The Aleottis came under fire in 2010 when Italian tax authorities accused them of tax evasion, demanding a reported $1.6 billion from the family, a move judgement annulled by the Italian Supreme Court in 2013. After an initial settlement with tax authorities in 2011, Lucia, Alberto Giovanni, and their mother Massimiliana were again accused of tax evasion by Italian authorities in 2013 to the tune of $160 million, which was added to a new investigation. In September 2016, the siblings were found guilty of corruption and money laundering charges. Lucia and Alberto Giovanni were sentenced to ten and seven years, respectively. A spokesperson for Menarini told Forbes that the siblings will appeal their sentences.
