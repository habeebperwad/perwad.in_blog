			Together Hank and Doug Meijer run Michigan-based grocery chain Meijer. The brothers are co-chairman of the company and Hank is also CEO. They took control of the family-owned company in 1990 when their father, Frederik stepped down.  The company was founded in 1934 by their father along with their grandfather, Hendrik, a Dutch immigrant. The first store was called North Side Grocery. A few years later, the name was changed to Meijer's Grocery. Hendrik and Frederik opened Thrifty Acres in 1962, one of the first stores in the country to offer one-stop shopping: Customers could buy groceries, clothing, and toys all in the same store. Frederik ran the company from 1964 to 1990. Meijer operates more than 230 stores throughout the Midwest. In June 2015 it opened its first stores in Wisconsin and plans to expand to Cleveland in 2018.
