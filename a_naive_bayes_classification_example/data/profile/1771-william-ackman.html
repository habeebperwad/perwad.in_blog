			The collapse of Valeant Pharmaceuticals continues to take a toll on Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund firm, which saw significant asset outflows and another down year in 2016. Ackman's main fund, Pershing Square International, fell 10.2% in 2016, while his publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings saw NAV drop 13.5%. New investment Chipotle Mexican Grill has so far yielded heartburn for Ackman, who sold positions in Canadian Pacific and Zoetis in 2016. Overall, Ackman's wealth has taken a hit and it stands to fall further.  Ackman may soon lose his billionaire status as details of his divorce with wife, Karen Ackman, are hammered out.
