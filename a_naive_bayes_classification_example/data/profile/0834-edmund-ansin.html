			Edmund Ansin inherited a real estate fortune and has added television stations to his portfolio. More than half a century ago he paid $3.4 million for Miami's WSVN, which pioneered the "if it bleeds, it leads" style of TV journalism.  He took that approach to his native Boston market, where operated NBC and CW affiliate stations. In 2016 NBC announced it would ditch Ansin in favor of its own channel starting in 2017. Ansin sued NBC parent Comcast, alleging a violation of contract and anti-trust laws, but the case was dismissed. Back in the '50s, he and his father Sidney used proceeds from the family's Boston shoemaking business to buy Florida real estate. Ansin owns commercial real estate in Florida and Indianapolis. His son Andrew has been working with Edmund since 1985 and oversees construction projects like the Miramar Park of Commerce, a 5 million sq. foot development in south Florida.
