			Fertilizer tycoon Alexander Rovt has been pouring his money into real estate and owns more than 30 investment properties, mostly apartment buildings in New York City. His IBE Trade trades ammonium-based fertilizer.  Rovt grew up poor in Carpathia, a contested former Soviet territory, and attended the prestigious Lvov State University of Trade and Economics in the Ukraine. He holds a Ph.D in international economics. He managed a high-end Hungarian resort in the U.S.S.R. before emigrating to New York, where he first ran a deli and then sold jewelry. He says he has never invested money in a stock or bond, preferring hard assets like housing.
