			Indian pharma magnate Murali Divi founded generics maker Divi's Laboratories 27 years ago in south India. Today, it is one of the world's largest producers of Naproxen, the ingredient in a popular anti-inflammatory drug.  Divi's shares tumbled in December after an adverse inspection of its factory by the U.S.Food & Drug Administration. The company said it had filed a detailed response addressing the FDA's concerns. A fitness fanatic, Divi does yoga every day and spends weekends at his organic farm.
