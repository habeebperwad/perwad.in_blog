			Lirio Parisotto built his fortune on the Brazilian stock market. A former entrepreneur, he invested profits from Videolar, a video and audiotape company he founded in 1988. Parisotto's portfolio runs the gamut from banking, electricity and mining to steel companies.  He avoids IPOs and favors stocks that pay high dividends.  In addition, Parisotto owns Brazilian bonds, real estate throughout Brazil, and still owns a majority stake at Videolar, which merged with Innova to become a petrochemical company operating four high-tech industrial facilities: three in the Manaus Industrial Pole (in the Amazon, north of Brazil) and one at the Southern Petrochemical Pole, in southern Brazil. Parisotto  is vice president of the Foundation for a Sustainable Amazon.
