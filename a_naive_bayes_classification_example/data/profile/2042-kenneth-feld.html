			Kenneth Feld owns live entertainment company Feld Entertainment, which is the parent company of Disney on Ice, Monster Jam and Ringling Bros. circus. Feld announced in January 2017 that Ringling Bros. would be shutting down in May 2017 due to falling ticket sales.  Kenneth Feld's father, Irvin, bought Ringling Bros. circus in 1967 for $8 million. Irvin and Ken sold the Greatest Show on Earth to Mattel in 1971 for $50 million in stock before buying it all back 1982 for an estimated $23 million. Ken took over in 1984 following his father's death. Since then, he has worked to diversify beyond the Big Top. A Disney on Ice version of the hit movie Frozen has been particularly popular. While Feld remains CEO, he's preparing his three daughters to succeed him as ringmaster.
