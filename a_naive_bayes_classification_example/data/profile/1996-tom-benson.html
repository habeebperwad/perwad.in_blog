			Tom Benson started out as a bookkeeper at a Chevrolet dealership in New Orleans before funneling his earnings into auto dealerships, local banks and, eventually, sports teams. He bought the Saints (NFL) in 1985 and picked up the Pelicans (NBA) in 2012. In New Orleans Benson also owns a 26-story office building that's named for him and Champions Square, an outdoor entertainment venue next to the Superdome arena where the Saints play.  Benson spent the past few years locked in a bitter dispute over control of much of his fortune. He had been planning on leaving his teams to his daughter and two grandchildren, but in January 2015 decided instead to leave them to Gayle, his wife of 10 years. His daughter and grandchildren sued, at one point claiming Benson was no longer competent to run the teams. In June 2015 a judge declared Benson competent. But when he tried to exchange team stock held by trusts for some $500 million in promissory notes and forgiven debt, his (potential) heirs moved to reject the deal. The parties reached a confidential settlement, ending all litigation, in February 2017.
