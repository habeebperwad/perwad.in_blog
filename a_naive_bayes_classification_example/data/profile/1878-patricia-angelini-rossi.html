			Patricia Angelini Rossi inherited a stake in Grupo Empresas Angelini, the investment group headed by her brother, Roberto Angelini Rossi. The group's largest holding is publicly-traded Antarchile, which distributes fuel, operates fishing and shipping businesses and invests in energy and forestry.  Antarchile's forestry subsidiary, Arauco, entered North America in 2012 with the purchase of Canada's Flakeboard, which manufactures wood panels for furniture and wall covering. The Angelini family is very private, typically eschewing publicity. The group was previously headed by Patricia's uncle, Anacleto Angelini, who died in 2007.
