			P.V.Ramprasad Reddy chairs generics maker Aurobindo Pharma, which he co-founded in 1986. The company gets 85% of its $2.1 billion revenue from international markets. Last year, Aurobindo's shares fell  after a U. S. FDA inspection resulted in adverse observations about one of its factories that makes antiretroviral drugs. The company responded to the FDA's concerns and subsequently got an approval from the American regulator. Aurobindo recently expanded its European footprint with the $144 million acquisition of Portugal's pharma producer Generis Farmaceutica.
