			Idan Ofer is one of two sons of shipping magnate Sammy Ofer, who died in 2011 and was once Israel's richest man. Planning for the wealth transfer to Idan and his brother Eyal began years before their father's death, but it culminated in early 2014 with the legal separation of the two brothers' shipping empires.  Idan owns Quantum Pacific Group, which has a fleet of more than 150 bulk, container and crude vessels. He also owns a controlling stake in publicly-traded chemicals, energy and shipping conglomerate Israel Corporation. In early 2015, Israel Corp. spun off its power, transportation and shipping units into a listed firm called Kenon Holdings, of which Idan owns roughly half. He took his offshore deepwater drilling company Pacific Drilling public in 2012. Idan and Eyal split their father's art holdings, a rare collection rumored to include pieces by Van Gogh and Picasso. Idan Ofer gave $42 million to The London Business School in 2013; buildings there will be named after his late father.
