			In January 2016 Neal Patterson revealed to shareholders in an email that he had been diagnosed with a form of soft tissue cancer that is considered to be "treatable and curable." Patterson, who has built his fortune selling IT and electronic health record systems, said he would continue in his roles as Cerner CEO and chairman while receiving medical care.  The son of tenant farmers, Patterson co-founded the Kansas City-based company in 1979 with colleagues from Arthur Andersen's consulting business. Cerner flourished thanks to the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health (HITECH) law that forced U.S. hospital records to go digital. Patterson also co-owns the National Golf Club of Kansas City and the Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City.
