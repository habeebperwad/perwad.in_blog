			Alexander Vik comes from a wealthy family of fur merchants and has dabbled in everything from closed-end country funds to insurance companies and tech start-ups. He remains locked in a contentious legal dispute with Deutsche Bank, which late in 2013 obtained a $250 million judgement against Vik's trading operation from  the High Court of Justice in London.  Deutsche Bank had sued the trading operation, based largely out of Vik's Connecticut home, over a margin call that went unpaid during the financial crisis. So far Vik is not paying. He has appealed the London court's judgement, while Deutsche Bank has started legal proceedings in New York and Connecticut to investigate his assets. A Norwegian who was raised in Sweden and schooled in the Canary Islands, Vik was a former golf champion at Harvard University. An avid collector of art, he has developed luxury hotel properties in Uruguay and a winery in Chile. During the first Internet bubble, Vik was behind Xcelera.com, one of the biggest dot.com boom and bust stocks of the era.
