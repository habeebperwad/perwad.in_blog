			The family behind fashion retailer Riachuelo is led by its patriarch Nevaldo Rocha. He first started out in business with his brother Newton in 1947 with a clothing store the northeastern Brazil city Natal.  Under the banner Grupo Guararape, they bought the brand Riachuelo in 1979, which has since become the centerpiece of the business. The group has evolved into one of Brazil's three largest retailers with 40,000 employees. Under Nevaldo's direction, the company transformed from a clothing manufacturer to a fashion designer, producer and distributor. Riachuelo remains in the family with a majority stake held by Rocha and his three children. His son Flavio is chief financial office, his younger son Elvio serves on the board of directors and daughter Lisiane is the company's vice president. Each controls about 22% of the company's shares. The Rocha family also owns the Midway Shopping Center in Rio Grande do Sul and its retail finance arm Midway Financial, which provides financing to many of Riachuelo's shoppers.The third generation of the Rocha family is also getting involved: Nevaldo's granddaughter Marcella is a marketing manager; she orchestrated deals with Versace in 2014 and Karl Lagerfeld in 2015.
