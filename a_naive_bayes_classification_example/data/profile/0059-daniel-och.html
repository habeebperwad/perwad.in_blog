			Dan Och is trying to turn around a dismal situation at his Och-Ziff Capital Management. The publicly traded hedge fund firm has been hit with billions of dollars in redemptions and now manages about $33.6 billion.  The problems stem from Och-Ziff's involvement in a massive bribery scheme in Africa, resulting in the firm paying $412 million to resolve charges from U.S. prosecutors and regulators. In 2016, a unit of Och-Ziff even pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe foreign officials and Och himself was sanctioned by the Securities & Exchange Commission. Still, FORBES' reexamination of the terms of Och-Ziff's 2007 initial public offering resulted in an increase of our estimate of Och's net worth.
