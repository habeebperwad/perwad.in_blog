			Morris Kahn made his fortune as an original investor in Amdocs, a customer-relationship management-and-billing software firm for large telecom outfits. He sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares after Amdocs went public in 1998.  Kahn now lives on the Israeli coast and spends most of his time on a 100-foot yacht.  He is a cofounder of Coral World International, a string of aquariums in locations such as the Bahamas and Australia. His son Benjamin is a marine biologist and president of Coral World. Through his Aurum Ventures, Morris has invested in several emerging life science and tech companies, including Atlantium, which specializes in water disinfection, and N-Trig, which makes a touch screen for computers. He is also an active "venture philanthropist" with investments in digital learning platform Time to Learn and 3D printing company Nano Dimension. He also invests in Israeli youth program SpaceIL, which is designed to get kids interested in space exploration and has announced plans for a trip to the moon in 2017.
