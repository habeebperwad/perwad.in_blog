			Michael Hintze's London-based CQS hedge fund had a great year in 2016. His flagship Directional Opportunities fund bet on the debt of rebounding commodities companies, helping push returns above 30% net of fees.  It was something of a comeback for Hintze after his main hedge fund lost money in 2015. Born in China to Russian parents, Hintze was raised in Australia and served a three-year stint in the army before making his way to London in the 1980s. He is a noted supporter of the arts and sciences and was granted Knighthood in 2013 in recognition of his charitable contributions in the U.K. He maintains a connection to his home country through his MH Premium Farms, which owns a portfolio of agricultural properties in Australia.
