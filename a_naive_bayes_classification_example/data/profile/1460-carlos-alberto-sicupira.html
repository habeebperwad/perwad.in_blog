			Most of Carlos "Beto" Sicupira's wealth comes from his shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, in which he owns about a 3% stake. He is longtime business partners with Jorge Paulo Lemann and Marcel Herrmann Telles, both of whom are Brazilian billionaires.  In October 2016 the brewer completed its $106 billion acquisition of beer giant SABMiller. The trio also owns stakes, through their private equity firm 3G Capital, in New York Stock Exchange-listed Restaurant Brands International, parent of Burger King and Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons. In 2013 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought H.J. Heinz & Company for $23 billion. Heinz merged with Kraft in 2015, creating KraftHeinz, the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world. In Brazil Sicupira is known for his controlling stake in low-cost retailer Lojas Americanas and in real estate investment firm Sao Carlos Empreendimentos e Participacoes. He holds multiple world records for underwater spearfishing.
