			Randal Kirk has not had the typical attorney's career path. After graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1979, he passed the bar and opened a small-town practice. Five years later he partnered with two local clients, a pharmacist and a physician, to start an injectable drug and vaccine distributor, which eventually sold for $145 million in 1998. Since then, Kirk has been involved in a number of successful business ventures.  His latest and largest is biotech conglomerate Intrexon, where he became chairman and CEO in 2008. The company has made waves for its unique (and sometimes controversial) products, including a genetically modified salmon, an apple that never browns, and a modified species of mosquito that could be used to combat the spread of Zika virus. The son of a drill sergeant, Kirk divides his time between homes in San Francisco, West Palm Beach, and a farm in northwest Virginia. He commutes on a private Gulfstream jet.
