			B. Wayne Hughes cofounded Public Storage and amassed a fortune storing Americans' excess junk. He built his first storage unit in 1972, initially putting up a large sign reading "Private Storage Spaces." Only one customer showed up, asking if any spots were available to the public.  Hughes quickly changed the sign to "Public Storage" and the business took off. The company reported $2.6 billion in sales in 2016 and has more than 2,300 locations throughout the United States and Europe. Hughes serves as its chairman emeritus; his daughter, Tamara Gustavson, is a board member and the single largest shareholder. Both Gustavson and her brother, B. Wayne Hughes, Jr., are also billionaires. To take advantage of depressed real estate values during the Great Recession, Hughes formed a publicly-traded REIT, called American Homes 4 Rent, in 2011 to acquire, renovate and rent single-family homes. A lover of thoroughbred horse racing, he owns Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, which has a stable of stallions that have sired championship horses. Hughes was an usher at O.J. Simpson's wedding to Nicole Brown.
