			Gennady Timchenko has stakes in various Russian businesses including gas company Novatek, petrochemichal producer Sibur Holding, railway operator Transoil and construction firm STG Group. Considered one of the most powerful people in Russia, he has close ties to President Vladimir Putin and, as a result, faced U. S. sanctions in 2014 in response to Russia's intervention in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Timchenko sold his 43% stake in Gunvor Group, a leading international energy trader he cofounded, to his business partner Torbjorn Tornqvist in March 2014, a day before he was hit with sanctions."You have to answer for everything. Even for your friendship with the president," Timchenko once told Forbes.  He has continued selling his assets since that time. He remains chairman of the Russian national hockey league KHL and is president of the SKA Saint-Petersburg Hockey Club, which won the 2015 Gagarin Cup.
