			As cofounder and CEO of Palantir Technologies, Alexander Karp oversees the Palo Alto, Calif.-based software firm. It is worth an estimated $20 billion following a round of funding that closed in late 2015, raising $880 million.  Once a secretive data-mining startup that received early backing from CIA investment arm In-Q-Tel, the company now does a wide range of contract work for government agencies like the New York Police Department as well as major banks and corporations and is reportedly the largest holder of real estate in Palo Alto. Karp met fellow cofounder and billionaire Facebook investor Peter Thiel while at Stanford Law School. He holds a Ph.D. in German philosophy and managed money before starting Palantir in 2004. He is known for occasionally teaching meditation classes at Palantir.
