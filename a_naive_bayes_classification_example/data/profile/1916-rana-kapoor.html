			Mumbai banker Rana Kapoor debuts on the Forbes Billionaires list on rising shares of Yes Bank, in which he holds an 11.6% stake. Kapoor started his banking career with Bank of America in 1980 and became an entrepreneur in 1998 when he and two partners set up finance firm Rabo India Finance in a joint venture with the Netherland's Rabobank.  In 2003, the trio sold their stake in the company to the Dutch and snatched a banking licence. Today, Yes Bank is India's fifth largest bank in the private sector and featured for the first time in 2016 in the Forbes Global 2000 list. The bank and its board have been embroiled in a legal battle with the family of his late partner Ashok Kapur, who was killed in a terrorist attack in Mumbai's Oberoi Hotel in 2008.
