			Noam Gottesman's food investments span Manhattan fine dining to frozen food sold at supermarkets across Europe. His seven high-end restaurants in Manhattan and the Hamptons continue to earn stars. He first invested in Burger King and now owns about 200 franchises.  He then aimed for the top of the market, investing in Eleven Madison Park in 2011, which was awarded three Michelin stars for the first time the year after. He followed with NYC sister restaurant Nomad, which is now set to expand into LA in 2017. The Nomad name was also used for a publicly traded investment vehicle that he cofounded in 2014. It purchased Iglo Group (known for Birds Eye frozen products) in June 2015, and it's now Europe's largest frozen foods brand. Gottesman made his original fortune in hedge funds, cofounding London-based firm GLG Partners in 1995, initially a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. The firm was later spun off, went public in 2007 and was eventually sold to Man Group for $1.6 billion in 2010. Gottesman stepped down as CEO at the time of the sale. Gottesman, who was born in Israel and served in the Israeli army, immigrated to the US with his parents when he was young and lived abroad for several years. He now has homes in New York's West Village, The Hamptons, London and St. Barts.
