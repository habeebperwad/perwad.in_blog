			Brian Sheth co-founded Vista Equity Partners in 2000 and is the firm's president. He has helped rack up one of the best records in private equity buying and fixing up an unglamorous collection of enterprise software companies.  Neuberger Berman bought a stake in the Austin, Texas-based firm in July 2015. It had more than $17 billion in assets under management as of 2016. A graduate of University of Pennsylvania where he met his wife, he spent one year at Deutsche Bank, one year at Goldman Sachs and six months at Bain Capital. Robert Smith, who hired him at Goldman, then approached him about helping him start Vista. The son of an Indian immigrant who worked at the Department of Environmental Conservation and a teacher, he is the founding donor and chairman of Global Wildlife Conservation. He is also a director of more than a dozen companies.
