			Massimo Moratti is the CEO of Saras, Italy's largest oil refinery. Moratti and his brother Gian Marco took Saras public in 2006. The company, which their father Angelo founded in 1962, has a liquified fuel gasification plant, a wind farm in Sardinia and a chain of gas stations mainly in Spain.  Each brother owns a 25% stake in Saras. Moratti is perhaps better known for his role in soccer club Inter Milan. In 2014, he stepped down from the presidency of the world-renowned team following his 2013 sale of a 70% stake to Indonesian tycoon Erick Thohir and other investors. In June 2016, Chinese appliance billionaire Zhang Jindong's firm Suning Holdings purchased the majority of the team, including Moratti's remaining 30% stake. Moratti's 19-year tenure at Inter Milan included five straight Italian titles and the elusive treble in 2010, which included the Champions League and the Club World Cup titles.
