			Turnaround king C. Dean Metropoulos' latest success is the snack foods brand Hostess. He and Apollo Global Management bought the company out of bankruptcy in 2013 for $410 million. In November 2016, Metropoulos and Apollo took Hostess public via a special purpose acquisition entity created by billionaire Alec Gores' private equity firm, The Gores Group.  This was not the first time that Metropoulos, who emigrated from Greece with his parents at age 10, took a beaten-down brand and spruced it up. He sold Pabst Brewing in 2014 for an estimated $750 million after transforming what was a blue-collar man's beer into a hipster brand. He previously bought, turned around and sold brands like Chef Boyardee, Pam cooking spray, Bumble Bee tuna and Perrier-Jouet champagne.
