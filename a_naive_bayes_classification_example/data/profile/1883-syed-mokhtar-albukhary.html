			With a $4.5 billion construction order book for his listed flagship, MMC Corp, reclusive tycoon Syed Mokhtar AlBukhary is on a high. The infrastructure behemoth won a $3.96 billion rail tunneling project in 2016, along with its 50:50 joint venture partner Gamuda.  The order is part of the buildout of the Klang Valley mass transit system linking Kuala Lumpur to its suburbs. MMC will be involved with the design and construction of tunnels, underground stations and escape shafts for the second line of the system. In January 2017 MMC bought a 70% stake in KMB Seaport, which operates the Tanjung Bruas Port in Malacca, located at the most central and narrowest part of the Straits of Malacca. Analysts say the company, which listed Gas Malaysia in 2012 and energy outfit Malakoff in 2015, is now looking to take its port operations public, but only next year or 2019. He founded Albukhary International University, providing full tuition to financially needy students, as well as the Islamic Art Museum. A high school dropout, AlBukhary came from a modest family and started out as a rice trader.
