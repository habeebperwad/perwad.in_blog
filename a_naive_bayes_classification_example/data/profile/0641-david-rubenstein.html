			David Rubenstein is one of the three financiers behind $158 billion (assets) private equity firm Carlyle Group. Rubenstein got his start as a Carter Administration official and later became an attorney. He cofounded Carlyle in 1987 with William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello.  Conway scrutinized the deals; D'Aniello handled administrative tasks. Rubenstein raised the money and managed its stable of advisers, which included George H.W. Bush and ex-British prime minister John Major. Rubenstein donated $18.5 million in 2016 to restore the 94-year-old Lincoln Memorial and expand exhibits and research there. It's the fourth national monument that Rubenstein has helped refurbish. In all, he's given $44 million towards historic preservation of U.S. attractions, including the Washington Monument. He has also funded panda procreation at the National Zoo.
