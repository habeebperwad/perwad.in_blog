			Katharina Andresen is the world's second-youngest billionaire. She and her sister Alexandra, age 20, came into their 10-figure-fortunes when their father, Johan Andresen, transferred 42% of the family-owned investment company, Ferd, to each of them.  The Andresen family has been a household name in Norway for over 100 years, primarily known for its tobacco brand Tiedemanns. In 2005 the family sold its stake in the tobacco business to Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni for $480 million. Today Ferd runs hedge funds, is an active investor on the Nordic stock exchange, and has private equity investments. Neither Alexandra nor Katharina works for the company, which is still run by their father Johan who controls 70% of the votes via a dual-class share structure. Katharina is currently studying at Amsterdam University College.
