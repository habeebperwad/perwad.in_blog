Khosla studied engineering in India, then at age 20 tried and failed to start a soy-milk company.  He moved to the U.S., got a Stanford MBA, then cofounded Sun Microsystems in 1982. Khosla's lately found unlikely difficulties in local surfers, as he's repeatedly faced legal setbacks in a struggle to keep the public from accessing his private beach near Half Moon Bay in California. In February 2016, Khosla reportedly offered to sell the beach property to the state of California for $30 million.
