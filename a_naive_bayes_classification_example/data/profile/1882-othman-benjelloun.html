			Othman Benjelloun's father was a large shareholder in a small Moroccan insurance company. Benjelloun took over in 1988 and built it into privately held RMA Watanya, a leading insurance company. He then used it to expand into banking.  Today he is chairman of BMCE Bank, Africa's second largest bank with operations in 20 African countries, including Senegal, Kenya and Congo. Through his holding company FinanceCom, he is also the majority shareholder of insurance company RMA Watanya and has a minority stake in Meditelecom, Morocco's second largest mobile phone operator. His Paris-based money management firm, FinanceCom Asset Management, invests in companies in Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana, among other countries. To house BMCE's new headquarters, Benjelloun is building a 30-story rocket-shaped tower that will loom over Casablanca. He co-owns Ranch Adarouch, where he raises livestock and keeps race horses.
