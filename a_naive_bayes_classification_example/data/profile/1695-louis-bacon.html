			Louis Bacon's hedge fund Moore Capital continues to shed assets, but 2016 was a decent year with both his Moore Macro and Moore Global funds making money. President Donald Trump's election and the sharp rise in interest rates that followed helped Bacon's funds rally into year-end.  Bacon is a staunch supporter of environmental protections through his Moore Charitable Foundation, which helped his alma mater, Middlebury College, achieve carbon neutrality in December 2016. He added $50 million in funds to the foundation in 2016, making up for a $25 million loss from a fraud conducted by now-jailed former PTJ Partners executive Andy Caspersen.
