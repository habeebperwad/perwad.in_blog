			Hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert took over as Sears CEO in 2013, promising a turnaround. Instead he has presided over a remarkable dismantling. Having already spun off Lands' End, Sears Canada, Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores and much of the company's real estate, the core company was worth less than $1 billion in 2017. Revenues have fallen every year since 2006. A lawyer's son, Lampert read corporate reports and financial textbooks in high school before heading to Yale, where he was a member of Skull & Bones.  After graduating, he learned alongside fellow billionaire investor Daniel Och in the risk arbitrage department at Goldman Sachs before going solo in 1988. He survived a kidnapping in 2003 and was released by his captors after two days.
