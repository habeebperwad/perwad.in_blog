			Bidzina Ivanishvili was elected prime minister of Georgia in October 2012. Thirteen months later he stepped down after his party won the presidential elections, saying he'd fulfilled his task. In July 2016 a concert hall, Black See Arena, in which he invested about $120 million, opened.  Georgia's richest person by far, he made his money in Russia and moved back home in 2003. Over the years he sold off his businesses and reinvested the proceeds in hedge funds, private equity funds and art. He entrusted about $1 billion to Credit Suisse but more than $100 million of that sum was apparently stolen by the bank's manager. Ivanishvili is suing him in Switzerland. Businessman and philanthropist Ivanishvilli lives in a 108,000-square-foot compound in the mountains overlooking Tbilisi. Prolific art collector, he sold three paintings for more than $110 million in 2016 including Untitled XXV by Willem de Kooning for $66 million.  He still has a vast collection, including Dora Maar with Cat by Picasso, that's worth an estimated $1 billion.
