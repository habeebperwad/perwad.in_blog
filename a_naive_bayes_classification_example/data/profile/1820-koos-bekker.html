			Koos Bekker is revered as an astute executive who transformed South African newspaper publisher Naspers into a digital media powerhouse, primarily due to his 2001 bet on Chinese Internet and media firm Tencent.  During his tenure as CEO, which began in 1997, Bekker oversaw a rise in the market capitalization of Naspers from about $600 million to $45 billion, while drawing no salary, bonus, or benefits. He was compensated via stock option grants that vested over time. Bekker, who retired as the CEO of Naspers in March 2014, returned as chairman in April 2015. 
Over the summer of 2015 he sold more than 70% of his Naspers shares.  His Babylonstoren estate, which features architecture dating back to 1690, stretches across nearly 600 acres in South Africa's Western Cape region and includes  a farm, orchard, vineyard, a 14-room hotel and a restaurant.
