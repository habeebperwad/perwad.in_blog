			Carlos Ardila Lulle built a fortune selling soda pop in Colombia and got richer still investing in bottling companies, sugar refineries, radio stations and television channels. He started his career working for his father-in-law's soda company, where he created an apple-flavored drink that quickly became a top seller.  In 1973 he bought his first radio station and built Radio Canal Nacional by snatching up smaller stations. When the Colombian government privatized television in 1998, he started RCN TV, now worth significantly more than his radio properties. In 2012 he partnered with Rupert Murdoch to create MundoFox, a Spanish-language channel targeted at U.S. Hispanics. He now owns several bottling companies, the largest sugar refinery in Colombia and Colombian soccer team Atletico Nacional.
