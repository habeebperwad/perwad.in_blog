			Russian aluminum billionaire Deripaska employed Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign head, to help further Russia's President Vladimir Putin's interests, according to an Associated Press report.  Deripaska had been one of the key moguls awarded contracts in Sochi in the lead up to the 2014 Olympics. He also married into former President Boris Yeltsin's family. A former metals trader, he assumed control of Russian Aluminum in 2000 at age 31. He was the nation's richest person and 9th richest in world in 2008 before nearly losing it all due to crashing markets and heavy debts. He personally negotiated with the Russian government, banks and other creditors to restructure his loan obligations. Today, through his Basic Element, he owns stakes in UC Rusal, a leading aluminum producer; EuroSibEnergo, one of the largest hydroelectric power producers in the world; GAZ Group, a leading automotive company; Ingosstrakh, an insurance company, and AgroHolding Kuban, a large agricultural company in Russia.
