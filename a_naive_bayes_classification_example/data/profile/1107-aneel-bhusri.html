			Aneel Bhusri serves as CEO of Workday, an enterprise software firm, and as an advisory partner at venture capital mainstay Greylock Partners. He cofounded Workday with fellow billionaire David Duffield. After some high profile investment failures during the dot-com era, Bhusri notched big returns at Greylock in 2007 when storage software outfit PolyServe sold to Hewlett-Packard for $200 million, and OutlookSoft was acquired by SAP.  Some of his investments at Greylock also include Cloudera, Domo and ServiceNow. When not at Workday, Bhusri spends his time golfing. He also works with a number of charitable organizations including the Tipping Point Community, which works to eradicate poverty in the Bay Area, Harlem's Children Zone and the BASIC Fund.
