			Carolus Nolet Sr's family has been in the spirits business for more than three hundred years. In the late 17th century Joannes Nolet started a small distillery in Schiedam, Netherlands. Tenth-generation family member Carolus became chairman in 1979, and now works closely with his sons Carl Jr.  and Bob to pass on the Nolet trade. In 2008 the Nolet family joined with beverage giant Diageo to form a joint venture to handle Ketel One vodka, a signature Nolet brand. Diageo paid $900 million for its 50% share; it is now Ketel One's exclusive global distributor.
