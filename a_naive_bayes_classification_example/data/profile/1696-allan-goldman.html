			Allan Goldman co-chairs America's most valuable, family-run real estate portfolio with his younger sister Jane. They run Solil Management, which owns at least 400 properties across New York City, from retail and office space along Madison Avenue in midtown, to high-end coops on the Upper East Side and a 17% stake in the World Trade Center developments in lower Manhattan.  The two took over the business' leadership when their father Sol, a legendary real estate investor, died in 1987. Sol started buying up foreclosed properties for bargain prices in the 1950s. His trademark was all-cash deals whenever possible. His four low-profile children have preserved his investments, rarely selling. Each has an equal 25% stake.  Several years ago, Allan stepped back his work day-to-day due to health issues. Allan's son, Steven, is being prepped to one day take over his management role, along with Jane's son, Michael.
