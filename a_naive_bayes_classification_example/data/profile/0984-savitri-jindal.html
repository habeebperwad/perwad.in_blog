			After declining last year, the fortune of steel and power clan, whose matriarch Savitri Jindal chairs the O.P Jindal Group, rose as steel prices recovered. Mumbai-based son Sajjan saw shares of his JSW Steel almost double in the past year.  The company has joined a consortium that is bidding against fellow billionaire Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal, to acquire Italian steelmaker Ilva. Last year, he agreed to buy a 1,000-megawatt thermal power unit for $750 million from his younger sibling Naveen's Jindal Power & Steel, which is weighed down by $6.8 billion in debt.
