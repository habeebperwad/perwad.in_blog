			Regina de Camargo Pires Oliveira Dias is one of three billionaire sisters who are the controlling shareholders of multinational construction and cement conglomerate Camargo Correa. The conglomerate was founded in 1939 by Regina's father, Sebastiao Camargo, who died in 1994. Today Camargo Correa has operations in 16 countries and employs 27,000 workers.  Some of the group's top executives were the first construction-industry executives to be sentenced due to their alleged involvement in the ongoing Petrobras bribery investigation Lava Jato ("Car Wash") -- three were arrested, including Camargo Correa's former chairman Joao Ricardo Auler, who denied all charges. In 2015 Camargo Correa sold its stake in Alpargatas, the maker of Havaianas flip-flops, to Brazilian conglomerate J&F for $500 million.  Regina is married to Carlos Pires Oliveira Dias, the controlling stakeholder of Raia Drogasil, Brazil's largest drugstore chain in revenues and number of stores.
