			Nonagenarian Henry Hillman has continued to pour millions of dollars into his foundation, which funds projects in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Hillman followed his father into the family business, Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical, in 1946. When his father died in 1959, he bought out his 5 siblings, sold off the company's assets, and reinvested in real estate, private equity and venture capital.  He was an early investor in both private equity firm KKR and California venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers. Elsie, Hillman's wife of 70 years and a former Republican national committeewoman, passed away in August 2015 at age 89.
