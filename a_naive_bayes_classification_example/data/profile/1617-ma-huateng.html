			Tencent chairman Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, is an engineer who has led the social media firm to become one of China's most valuable public companies. Tencent's popular services include mobile texting app WeChat (used by 800 million people), which also works as a mobile wallet and social network.  Ma transferred about 100 million Tencent shares, worth $2 billion, to his charitable foundation in April 2016. Because the Hong Kong Stock Exchange still lists them in his name, FORBES has not yet deducted the shares from his net worth.
