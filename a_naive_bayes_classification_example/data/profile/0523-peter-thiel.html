			Peter Thiel has gone from successful entrepreneur to successful venture capitalist. The PayPal cofounder was Facebook's first professional investor, giving Mark Zuckerberg and his hoodied cohorts a $500,000 check in 2004 in return for more than 10% of the company.  Thiel still sits on Facebook's board, but sold most of his stake in the Menlo Park, Calif.-based social networking company following its May 2012 IPO. His various venture firms include Founders Fund, which backed rocket builder SpaceX and CIA-backed data-mining software company, Palantir, where he is also a cofounder. FORBES revealed in May 2016 that Thiel was secretly funding the legal costs of Hulk Hogan, a former professional wrestler who sued website Gawker for publishing a sex tape of him with his friend's wife. That lawsuit led to a $140 million verdict in favor of Hogan and set in motion a process that led to Gawker filing for bankruptcy in June 2016. Thiel also supported Donald Trump's 2016 bid for president, and was appointed to Trump's transition team following his electoral victory.
