			Ray Dalio is the founder of the world's biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, which manages $160 billion. His big Pure Alpha hedge fund suffered losses in the first half of 2016, but bounced back to end the year up by 2.4%. His All Weather fund, which seeks to perform well in good markets and bad, was up by 11.6%. One of Bridgewater's smaller hedge funds, Pure Alpha Major Markets, was up by 12.9%. Dalio has been rearranging management at the top of his hedge fund firm.  Greg Jensen, long seen as Dalio's heir apparent, gave up his co-CEO title while remaining Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer. Dalio hired Jon Rubinstein, a former executive at Apple, as Bridgewater's co-CEO, but Rubinstein left in March 2017. Dalio returned to the co-CEO position for about one year but announced in March 2017 that he was stepping down from it. Dalio had been working for years to institutionalize the firm he founded, reducing his stake in Bridgewater and putting others in leadership roles. He remains co-CIO at the firm and has told clients he expects "to remain a professional investor at Bridgewater until I die."
