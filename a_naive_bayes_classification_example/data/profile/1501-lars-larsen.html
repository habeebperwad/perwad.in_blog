			Lars Larsen is the founder and owner of JYSK, a bedding and home furnishings chain with more than 2,300 stores in 43 countries throughout Europe, Canada, and Asia. Capitalizing on the popularity of the Scandinavian design aesthetic, JYSK has been working to emphasize its Danish roots in store displays, particularly in China.  Larsen grew up on a potato farm and apprenticed in a bedding store before opening his first warehouse in 1979. A quarter of a century later, he sent 2.4 million copies of his autobiography to every household in Denmark, becoming the country's most widely-read author. Nicknamed "Duvet Larsen," he regularly appears in TV commercials for JYSK.
