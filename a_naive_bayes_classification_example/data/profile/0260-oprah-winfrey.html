			Onetime queen of the small screen Oprah Winfrey has turned her focus to journalism and filmmaking. In January 2017 news broke that Winfrey will be a contributor to the CBS news show 60 Minutes. In the fall of 2016, she shot back-to-back roles in the biopic 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' and 'A Wrinkle In Time,' an adaptation of the fantasy novel.  Ratings at the Oprah Winfrey Network continue to climb. The 2016 premiere of megachurch drama 'Greenleaf' was the network's most-watched debut, with 3.04 million viewers. She purchased a 10% stake Weight Watchers in October 2015; its stock plunged after an initial surge, resulting in its CEO leaving in September 2016. Winfrey is helping to find a replacement. The media mogul overcame a tough childhood: raised on a farm without indoor plumbing, she survived serial abuse and rape, and became a mother as a teen. Her son died in infancy. Her way out came in the form of a federal program that gained her access to a rich suburban school. She discovered a knack for public speaking and debate, which earned her a part-time radio gig and, later, a scholarship to Tennessee State University. Her long-running Oprah Winfrey Show was the highest-rated television talk show in U.S. history.
