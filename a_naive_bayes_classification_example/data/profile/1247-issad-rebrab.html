			Issad Rebrab founded Algeria's biggest privately held conglomerate, Cevital. It owns one of the largest sugar refineries in the world, with an annual output of 1.6 million tons; it also produces vegetable oil and margarine.  Rebrab has been diversifying by buying European companies in distress. In 2014, he acquired Groupe Brandt, a large French-based maker of appliances that had filed for bankruptcy protection. Cevital has invested more than $200 million to build a Brandt plant in Algeria. Rebrab was reportedly a customer of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which helped him set up offshore firms to register a Swiss bank account, in defiance of Algerian laws. Rebrab, whose five children work at the company, is the son of militants who fought for Algeria's independence from France.
