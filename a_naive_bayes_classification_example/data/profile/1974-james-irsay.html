			Jim Irsay inherited the Indianapolis Colts from his father, Robert Irsay (d. 1997). After getting a degree in broadcast journalism from Southern Methodist University, where he joined the football team as a walk-on, Jim went to work for the Colts.  He did everything from ticket sales to public relations before being named the NFL franchise's general manager at age 24. Following his father's death, Irsay became 100% owner. Since then the Colts have become noticeably more successful, notching 14 winning seasons (including a Super Bowl win in 2006). In June 2016 Irsay rewarded star quarterback Andrew Luck with a six-year, $140 million deal -- the biggest in NFL history. An avid collector, Irsay owns an original manuscript of the Jack Kerouac novel "On the Road" plus guitars from several rock legends, including Prince, Bob Dylan and Jerry Garcia.
