			Peter Kellogg joined his father, James Kellogg, at the older Kellogg's brokerage house Spear, Leeds & Kellogg in 1973 and took over several years later. Under his leadership, the brokerage thrived, becoming the first specialist brokerage to control more than 10% of the stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  In 2000, Kellogg sold the firm to Goldman Sachs for $6.5 billion in cash and stock. He plowed some of the proceeds into reinsurance outfit IAT; he stepped down from his position as CEO of IAT in January 2015, but remains chairman of the board. Kellogg has donated more than $4 million to the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams, as well as some $40 million to his alma mater The Berkshire School, a prep school in Sheffield, Massachusetts.
