			William Austin opened his first hearing-aid repair shop in 1967 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. He built it into one of the world's largest hearing aids companies, Starkey Hearing Technologies. The private company sells about 900,000 hearing aids a year, and its customers have reportedly included five U. S. presidents, two popes and singer Dolly Parton. Austin, the company's sole shareholder, no longer runs the company. Instead he focuses on the Starkey Hearing Foundation, which receives a cut of every product his company sells. The foundation has donated some 1 million hearing aids around the world to people who can't afford them.
