			Singapore's veteran banker Wee Cho Yaw is chairman emeritus of United Overseas Bank, cofounded by his father in 1935 and now the island-nation's third-largest lender. The economic slowdown took a toll on UOB's revenues in 2016 which dropped 3.5% to $2.2 billion, amid rising bad loans to the oil and gas and shipping sectors.  Shortly after the Brexit vote the bank halted loans for the purchase of London property. In January, Wee made a splash in Singapore real estate with his purchase of 45 apartments in The Nassim, a luxury condo, at an 18% discount on the market price for a total of $290 million.
