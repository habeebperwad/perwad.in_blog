			Luca Garavoglia, chairman of Campari Group, joined the billionaire ranks after the death of his mother, Rosa Anna Magno Garavoglia, in November 2016. He owns at least 26% of listed firm Davide Campari, the world's sixth largest alcoholic beverage company by sales, and controls his family's 51% stake in the company.  Campari Group was founded more than 150 years ago; its 50 brands in 190 countries include Skyy Vodka, Wild Turkey, and Campari. Luca's late father, Domenico, was a long-time employee at Campari before the last remaining heir to the Campari family, Angiola Maria Migliavacca, gave Domenico control of the company. Domenico died in 1992. Luca Garavoglia then led the company through a period of aggressive acquisitions and an IPO in 2001. He also serves on the board of the Fund for the Italian Environment and the European Institute of Oncology Foundation.
