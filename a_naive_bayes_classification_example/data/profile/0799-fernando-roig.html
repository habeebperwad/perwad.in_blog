			Fernando Roig owns a 9% stake in Spanish supermarket chain Mercadona. He also owns Pamesa, a privately-held ceramic tile manufacturer, and Spanish soccer team Villarreal CF. In 2013 he reduced his stake in Mercadona and used the proceeds to pay some of the team's debt after it lost its spot in the Spanish league's first division.  His billionaire brother Juan Roig is the majority shareholder of Mercadona, which was founded by their parents in 1977. Juan and Fernando took over Mercadona with their sisters in 1981 when it was only an eight-store chain. Since then they have turned it into one of Europe's largest food retailers, with 1,614 supermarkets. The company distributes 25% of its pre-tax profits to its 76,000 employees.
