			Eduardo Hochschild's great uncle founded the Hochschild Group, focused in the commercialization of minerals, in 1911. Eduardo joined the business, which his father had acquired, as a mine safety assistant in 1987; he was appointed head of Hochschild Mining Group 11 years later.  Today, Hochschild chairs both Hochschild Mining and Cementos Pacasmayo, which makes cement and other construction materials. Based in Lima, Hochschild Mining trades on the London Stock Exchange and operates gold and silver mines in Peru, Chile and Argentina. Cementos Pacasmayo trades on the Peruvian stock exchange and also on the New York Stock Exchange, where it listed its shares in February 2012. In 1998 during a period of political unrest in Peru, Hochschild survived an attack by a gunman that claimed the life of his father. Hochschild was kidnapped by the attackers, but released six days later.
