He was named chairman of holding company Kazakhmys plc in 2005, before it became the first Kazakh company to list on the London Stock Exchange.  As a result of a restructuring announced in 2014, Kazakhmys PLC de-merged into private company Kazakhmys Corporation and a separate public company, KAZ Minerals plc.
