			Victor Rashnikov is majority owner of Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works (MMK). He got his start as a mechanic at the metals outfit back in 1967 and worked his way up. He built his ownership to nearly 100% by buying shares on the market, and he fought off takeover attempts by companies associated with fellow billionaire Iskander Makhmudov.  When he faced shortages of iron ore, he and his partners bought one of the biggest iron ore deposits in Russia. In 2007 he took MMK public on the London Stock Exchange and pocketed $1 billion. He stepped down as chief executive of MMK in 2011 after 14 years. His youngest daughter, Olga, joined the board and the strategic planning committee a year later. In 2015 Rashnikov launched his new $300 million (estimated cost), 460-foot yacht, "Ocean Victory." Most of his fortune is still held in MMK shares.
