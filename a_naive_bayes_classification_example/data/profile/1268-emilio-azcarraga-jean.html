			Emilio Azcarraga Jean is the president and CEO of Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa, one of the world's largest producers of Spanish language TV content. He became the CEO after the death of his father in 1997. In January 2015, Televisa sold its 50% stake in mobile phone company Iusacell back to its partner Grupo Salinas (owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego) for $717 million plus an undisclosed amount of debt.  It had purchased that stake from Salinas in 2012. AT&T then bought all of Iusacell from Salinas for $2.5 billion, including $800 million in debt. Televisa increased its hold on cable TV,  buying Mexican cable TV company Cablevision Red in January 2015 for $695 million. Televisa has acquired other cable TV companies in recent years. Azcarraga is a board member of Endeavor, an international non-profit development organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets.
