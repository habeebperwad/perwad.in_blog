Their grandfather founded Tetra Laval, which invented breakthrough aseptic Â­packaging technology that makes it possible to store beverages such as milk and orange juice in carton instead of glass bottles.  Their late father Gad ran the company for 46 years together with his brother Hans whom he bought out in 1995. Kirsten breeds horses in the UK. The siblings' mother, Birgit, an art historian and philanthropist, is no longer involved in the company.
