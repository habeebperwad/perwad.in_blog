			Sumner Redstone's legacy as a media great was tarnished by unsightly boardroom and courtroom dramas last year. Viacom and CBS, in which he is the controlling shareholder, faced an investor suit filed in January 2016 against the two companies for compensating Redstone even though he is "physically and mentally incapacitated;" it was dropped in March.  A former companion filed a suit against him in November 2015 that sought control over his healthcare decisions after she was written out of his estate plan. It was thrown out in May; she promptly filed another lawsuit against his daughter, Shari, over a loss of an expected $70 million inheritance. In May, Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and another longtime board member were removed from the trust that will govern Redstone's holdings upon his death. Three months later, Dauman was removed as Viacom's CEO after a decade at the helm. Redstone's father founded the cinema chain now known as National Amusements as Northeast Theatre Corporation in 1936; Redstone took over in 1954. He acquired control of Viacom in 1987 and spun off CBS in 2006. While a student at Harvard during World War II, Redstone was selected by a Japanese history professor to help break Japan's military and diplomatic codes. He later lectured at Harvard Law School, Brandeis University, and Boston University School of Law, where he taught one of the first entertainment law courses. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
