			Electrical engineer Rit Thirakomen debuts on rising shares of his Bangkok-listed MK Restaurant Group known for its value-for-money 'sukiyaki' restaurants, where customers cook their own food in a hotpot at their table.   It was founded by his late mother-in-law as a small Thai eatery in 1962. After co-founding a book publishing business in 1974, he took to the restaurant trade in 1987, spearheading, along with wife Yupin, the expansion into sukiyaki. Today it has more than 600 restaurants, including Japanese food chain Yayoi.
