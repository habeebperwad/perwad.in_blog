			Chan Tan Ching-fen is the wife of late Hong Kong property tycoon Chan Tseng-Hsi. Through Cole Enterprises Holdings she controls the largest shareholding in Hang Lung Group, which is run by eldest son, Ronnie.  His brother Gerald leads the family's Morningside Group, a private equity and venture capital investor. In past years the fortune was listed under the two sons. The fortune grew by $100 million in 2016 but is slipping in 2017 as mainland developers outbid Hang Lung for land.
