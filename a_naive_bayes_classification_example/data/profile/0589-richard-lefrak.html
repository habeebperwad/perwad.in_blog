			Richard LeFrak's great-great grandfather Maurice founded the LeFrak Organization in France in 1883. Maurice's son Aaron immigrated to the U.S. and started a branch of the family business in 1905. Richard LeFrak and his father Sam (d.  2003) transformed that business into one of the tri-state area's most prolific developers. The company is best known for LeFrak City, a 5,000 unit apartment complex in Queens, New York that Samuel built in 1959. Richard also owns over 16 million square feet of mixed-use space in Newport, N.J, directly across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan.
