			Cargill MacMillan is a member of the family behind Cargill, the largest private company in the U.S. The business makes money in all areas of food production from animal feed, meat, and crops to commodity trading and risk management.  Cargill divested itself of its stake in fertilizer maker Mosaic in 2011. William Cargill, the son of a Scottish sea captain, founded the Iowa grain storage business after the Civil War; his son-in-law, John MacMillan, took control 1909. No family member has run the company since Whitney stepped down as chief executive in 1995.
