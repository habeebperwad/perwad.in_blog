			Otto Philipp Braun is the son of Ludwig Georg Braun, who took over B. Braun Melsungen in 1977 -- when the company had just $24 million in annual sales -- and turned it into one of the world's largest manufacturers of medical products.  Employing some 54,000 people globally and generating around $6.5 billion in annual revenue, the company has four divisions: Hospital Care, whose products include infusion and injection solutions; Aesculap, a manufacturer of surgical instruments and devices; OPM (outpatient market), which sells medical products to practitioners outside of the hospital market; and Avitum, a provider of dialysis and other technologies relating to blood treatment. In early 2017, Otto Philipp, who owns 22.62% of B. Braun, resigned from the management board. The first sixth-generation family member to work in the company and serve on its board, he had been responsible for the company's Iberian Peninsula and Latin American regions. He has a masters of International Accounting and Finance from London's Cass Business School.
