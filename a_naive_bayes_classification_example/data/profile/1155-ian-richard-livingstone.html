Among their signature projects is Panama Pacifico, a master planned sustainable city that they are developing with Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal.  The finished development will include 20,000 residential properties, industrial parks and retail and commercial space. In addition, the duo's real estate company, London & Regional, is planning to build a seaside resort and villa community in Cuba, the first in the nation that will offer home sales to foreigners. Ian, a former optometrist, and Richard, a chartered surveyor, also own a chain of Holiday Inn Express hotels in Europe.
