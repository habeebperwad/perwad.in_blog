			Mark Walter works to keep a low profile, but he stepped into the spotlight in 2012 when his investment group (which included Magic Johnson) purchased the cash-strapped LA Dodgers with a winning $2.2 billion bid.  Walter helped found investment firm Guggenheim Partners in the late 1990s after he folded his Chicago-based fund, Liberty Hampshire, into the Guggenheim family office. Guggenheim Partners now boasts more than $240 billion in assets under management; Walter owns an estimated 18% slice of the firm. In addition to the company's extensive holdings, Walter maintains a vast personal investment portfolio, which includes a significant interest in the Delaware Life insurance company, a stake in the Los Angeles Sparks, and more than a half-million acres of real estate in Argentina.
