			Norma Lerner is the widow of Al Lerner (d. 2002), who made a fortune as founder of credit card giant MBNA. Al was born in Brooklyn, New York to Russian immigrants, and began his career selling furniture and investing his earnings in Cleveland-area real estate.  He bought control of Equitable Bancorp in 1981, combined the company with Maryland National in 1989, and spun off MBNA in 1991. The Lerner family eventually merged MBNA with Bank of America in 2005 to create a $35 billion credit card and banking behemoth. The Lerners are the former owners of the Cleveland Browns and the English Premier League's Aston Villa.
