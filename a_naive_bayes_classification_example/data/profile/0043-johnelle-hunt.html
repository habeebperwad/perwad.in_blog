			Co-founder of one of North America's largest transportation companies, Johnelle Hunt and her late husband, J.B. (d. 2006) started out with a rice hull packaging operation. The duo sold their home and took out loans to fund the venture.  Johnelle, who had been a stay-at-home mom, took on office duties such as coordinating product shipping and bookkeeping. She began working full time as the business took off. In 1969, the couple launched J.B. Hunt Transport Services after buying five used trucks and seven trailers. The Lowell, Ark. business went public in 1983 and now has over 22,000 employees. Hunt, who stepped down from the board in 2008, remains the largest individual shareholder.
