			Samuel "Si" Newhouse--along with his brother Donald--took over their father Sam's multimillion-dollar publishing and broadcasting empire, Advanced Publications, when Sam died in 1979. Si ran the company's magazine division, Conde Nast Publications, serving as its chairman for 40 years before quietly retiring to the role of chairman emeritus in early 2015. During his tenure, he and his brother expanded the media empire they inherited into one of the country's largest privately owned companies, adding additional newspapers and magazines--among them such titles as The New Yorker and Wired--to go along with existing publications like Vogue.  The two additionally acquired cable TV firm Bright House Networks, the online entertainment and social news site Reddit, and a sizable stake in Discovery Communications. They sold Bright House Networks to John Malone's Charter Communications in April 2016 for $11.4 billion in stock and cash. Si also owns an extensive art collection, including works by Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns.
