			Sarah MacMillan is one of four billionaire sisters who inherited an estimated 3% stake in Cargill Inc. when their father, W. Duncan MacMillan, died in 2006. The $107 billion (sales), Minnesota-based food giant has more than doubled its revenues since her father's death, boosting the fortunes of Sarah and her sisters -- Lucy Stitzer, Katherine Tanner and Alexandra Daitch.  Sarah MacMillan was once married to musician Blaine John Chaney, who played guitar in the 1980s Minneapolis rock group The Suburbs. Today she lives a very private life out of the spotlight. When reached by phone in 2014, she told FORBES: "I don't have time to chat."
