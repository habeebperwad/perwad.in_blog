			Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, is founder and chair of the Emerson Collective, an organization that uses entrepreneurship to advance social reform and to assist under-resourced students. She also cofounded College Track, a nonprofit program that helps disadvantaged students prepare for and graduate from college.  In Sept. 2015, Powell Jobs made a $50 million commitment to "XQ: The Super School Project," a nationwide competition that encourages participants to redevelop high school curriculum. In September 2016 XQ awarded grants to 10 schools, including $10 million to start a Los Angeles high school for homeless and foster youth. The Laurene Powell Jobs Trust has sold some of its stake in Disney; according to a January 2017 SEC filing, the trust owns 2.5% of Disney and Laurene Powell Jobs owns 4% of the media firm. (In 2015, the Trust owned 7.8% of the company.) The Disney stake, which is worth far more than her estimated 0.7% of Apple, stems from Disney's 2006 purchase of animation studio Pixar, which Steve Jobs owned.
