			Ron Sim, founder of OSIM International, maker of home massage chairs, took the company private last June when its market cap was $700 million, a move that helped him regain a spot in the Forbes billionaires ranks after dropping off last year.  Sim says the delisting from the Singapore stock exchange will allow OSIM the freedom to grow. OSIM also owns the GNC brand in parts of Asia, Richlife in China and TWG Tea. Last year, Sim and his company won a long-running legal battle with one of the co-founders of TWG. Sim's property portfolio includes a stake in Perennial Real Estate Holdings, which has sought to liquidate its partnership with the Kwee family for their jointly-owned iconic Capitol Singapore project.
