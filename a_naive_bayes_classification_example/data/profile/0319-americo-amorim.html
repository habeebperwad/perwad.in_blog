			Portuguese mogul Americo Amorim started out in his family's cork business, Corticeira Amorim, and now has stakes in an energy company and banks in several countries. His grandfather started Corticeira Amorim in 1870 and the business still processes about one quarter of the world's cork.  Amorim's biggest asset is an 18% stake in Portuguese oil and gas company Galp Energia. In October 2016 he announced his retirement as chairman of the board of Galp; his eldest daughter, Paula, who'd been working alongside her father for more than 25 years, was installed as chairwoman. Galp has operations on every continent but is especially active in oil exploration off the coasts of Brazil and Angola. In 2005 Amorim started Angola's Banco Internacional de Credito with Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo Santos. In 2014 he sold his stake to Isabel dos Santos.
