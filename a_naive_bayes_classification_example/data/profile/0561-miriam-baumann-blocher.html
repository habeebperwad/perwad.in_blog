			Miriam Baumann-Blocher is a majority shareholder of Ems-Chemie, the gigantic Swiss polymer and chemical manufacturer her family has run for decades. When in 2003 her father, Christoph Blocher, departed the company after 35 years to take a seat in the Swiss government's federal council, he sold his stake evenly to his four children.  The company, which generates $1.9 billion in sales, has a market cap of more than $10.3 billion. Over the years Miriam and her brother Markus sold most of their shares to their sisters, Magdalena and Rahel, and began businesses of their own. In 2007 Miriam purchased LÃ¤ckerli-Huus, a Swiss confectionery and baked goods company, which she still manages. In 2015 she married Matthias Baumann, the CEO of Pfister, a Swiss home goods company.
