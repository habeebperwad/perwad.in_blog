			David Penaloza Alanis is the son of David Penaloza Sandoval, the founder of construction and infrastructure company Grupo Tribasa, which was known for building and operating highways that charge fees, known as toll roads.  Tribasa ran into serious financial problems after the peso crisis in 1994 and, like others in the toll-road business, was forced to renegotiate its debts. After a nine year workout plan, the company emerged from its restructuring in 2003, began trading again on the Mexican stock exchange in 2005 and was renamed Promotora y Operadora de Infraestructura, or Pinfra, in 2006. During its restructuring, private investors injected new funds into the company, while David Penaloza Alanis replaced his father at the helm and as its largest shareholder. He owns about 30% of the company, which has 16 toll-road concessions throughout Mexico.
