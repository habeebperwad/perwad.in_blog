			Already 50 years old when he joined Facebook in 2005, Jeff Rothschild was by far the oldest executive at what was then just a young startup. He helped the social networking site scale as its VP of infrastructure engineering for five years before stepping back into an advisory role in 2010. He left Facebook in June 2015. Before Facebook, Rothschild started out developing network storage technologies at Honeywell and Intel.  He also cofounded several of his own Silicon Valley firms, the largest of which, Veritas Software, he sold to Symantec for $13.5 billion in stock in 2004. Rothschild is now focused on technology investing and serves on the boards of startups Primary Data, Interana and Lytmus. A trustee of Vanderbilt University, he was elected vice chairman of the board in 2016.
