			Steven Spielberg's 2016 adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel 'The BFG' flopped at the box office, grossing just $183 million worldwide on its estimated $140 million budget. It's a rare disappointment in an otherwise legendary career.  After failing to get into USC film school, Spielberg got his start as an unpaid intern in the editing department of Universal. Today, a slice of the cash from every ticket at Universal theme parks goes directly into Spielberg's pocket thanks to blockbuster hits like 'E.T.' and 'Jaws'. The veteran movie maker, who won the Academy Award for best director twice ('Shindler's List,' 'Saving Private Ryan'), has been directing for over 50 years and his films have grossed over $9 billion worldwide. Dreamworks Animation, the studio he founded with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, was sold to Comcast in 2016. His DreamWorks Studios has been relaunched as Amblin Partners with more than $300 million in new financing.
