			Straumann owns a 17% stake in the world's largest manufacturer of dental implants whose roots stretch back to 1954. That's the year Straumann's grandfather Reinhard Straumann founded an alloy research company.  Reinhard discovered bone's crystalline mineral structure and by 1967 when Thomas's father Fritz took over, the company had become an industry leader in fracture-healing metal implants. Under Fritz, Straumann Holding continued to experiment with the use of metals in medical devices, and met real success during the 1970's with the introduction of titanium dental implants. Thomas joined the company's board of directors in 1990 where he shifted focus to dental products only. Straumann Holding went public in 1998. In addition, Straumann chairs Medartis, which he founded in 1997. It makes implants for hand, wrist, elbow and foot fractures. He also owns the luxurious Swiss Hotel Les Trois Roi and a stable of jumping horses.
