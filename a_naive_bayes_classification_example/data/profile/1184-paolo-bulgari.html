			Paolo Bulgari, a great grandson of the founder of luxury jeweler Bulgari, joined the company when he was 18. A law student at the time, he was asked by his father to design necklaces, rings, and bracelets.  Paolo has designed jewelry for generations of Hollywood actresses, from Elizabeth Taylor to Nicole Kidman. He became chairman of Bulgari in 1984, while his brother Nicola took on the role of vice chairman and their nephew, Francesco Trapani, acted as chief executive. In 2011, with Bulgari firmly established as a global luxury brand behind not just jewelry but also watches, fragrances, apparel, hotels and resorts, the family sold its controlling stake to French billionaire Bernard Arnault's luxury goods giant LVMH for $5.2 billion in stock and cash. Paolo still sits on the LVMH advisory board.
