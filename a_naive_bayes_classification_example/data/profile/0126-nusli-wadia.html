			Chairman of the Wadia Group, a cookies-to-aviation empire with roots in shipbuilding dating back to 1736, Nusli Wadia is referred to as a 'corporate samurai' by the Indian press for waging numerous legal battles.  His latest is against the Tata conglomerate and his former pal Ratan Tata, who got him ousted from the boards of three Tata companies in December. Group companies include Britannia Industries, home textiles maker Bombay Dyeing and budget airline GoAir. Wadia is the grandson of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan.
