			Larry Robbins, founder of hedge fund firm Glenview Capital Management, is known for both his hot streaks and his cold streaks. Robbins' has recently been dealing with a chilly stretch. His main hedge fund was down 2.65% in 2016, his second straight down year after posting losses of 18.1% in 2015. But Robbins' funds have experienced big down periods before only to bounce back strongly.  Robbins staged a bit of a comeback in the second half of 2016, as his main hedge fund rebounded from double digit percentage losses in the first half of the year. He apologized to his investors about his losses in the fall of 2015. His firm now manages some $10 billion. Through his own Robbins Family Foundation, Robbins is an active supporter of education reform both in New York City and on the national level. He serves as chairman of the board for both KIPP New York and Relay Graduate School of Education. He is a member of the board of Teach For America (New York) and the senior chair of the Wall Street Division of the UJA-Federation.
