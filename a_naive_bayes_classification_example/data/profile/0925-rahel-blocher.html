			Rahel Blocher, along with sister Magdalena, is the largest shareholder of Ems-Chemie, the giant Swiss polymer and chemical manufacturer that her family has run for decades. When father Christoph Blocher departed from the company in 2003 after 35 years to serve in the Swiss government, he sold his stake evenly to his four children.  The company, which generates $1.9 billion, has a market cap of more than $10.3 billion. Rahel, the youngest sibling, and her sister Magdalena, the company's longtime CEO, hold shares equally through family holding company Emesta, but unlike her sister she isn't actively involved in company operations. Instead, she heads her father's investment company, Robinvest. Miriam also serves as the delegate on the board of trustees for a foundation her father established in Switzerland. Musikinsel, or "music hotel," was converted from an old monastery and now provides cheap practice space and housing for musicians of all genres.
