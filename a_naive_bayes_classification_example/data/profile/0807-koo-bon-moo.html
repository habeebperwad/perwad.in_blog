			Koo Bon-Moo is the chairman of LG Group, Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate by assets, with affiliates in industries ranging from electronics, home appliances and climate-control equipment to high-efficiency batteries, chemicals and professional sports.  In 1947, Koo's grandfather, Koo In-Hwoi, co-founded Lucky Chemical Industrial Corp. and began making a popular face cream called Lucky. Manufacturing caps and jars for the cream paved the way for Lucky to become Korea's first mass-producer of plastic goods. Koo began his career with the group in 1975, as a manager at LG Chemical (now LG Chem). He jumped to the group's flagship affiliate, LG Electronics, in 1980. Since becoming chairman of LG Group in 1995, succeeding his father Koo Cha-Kyung, the conglomerate's sales have risen from around $38 billion to over $140 billion. Koo's heir-apparent is his younger brother's son, Koo Kwang-Mo, whom he adopted in 2004. (Koo's own son died in an accident in the 1990s.)
