			Canada's Lawrence Stroll and Hong Kong's Silas Chou helped mastermind Michael Kors' hugely successful IPO in 2011. Three years later, they liquidated their 5.7% stake in the fashion brand and Stroll stepped down from the board after more than a decade of involvement; altogether since the IPO, they cashed out more than $3.5 billion.  The duo is also credited for the rise of Tommy Hilfiger in the 1990s. Stroll's penchant for style goes beyond apparel. He is an enthusiastic collector of vintage Ferraris, some of which he drives to races. He reportedly has more than 25 Ferraris in his collection. One of those, a 1967 GTB/4 S NART Spider, was purchased at an auction in 2013 for a record-breaking $27.5 million. His son Lance Stroll was the youngest member of the Ferrari Driver Academy from 2010 to 2015, a driving school for potential racers. Lance made his sports car racing debut in Daytona at age 17 in January 2016.
