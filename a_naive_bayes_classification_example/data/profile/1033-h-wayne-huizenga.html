			H. Wayne Huizenga hit it big in several industries, starting with garbage collection. At age 25, his dad loaned him $5,000, which he used to start his own waste pickup business with one truck. Within five years Huizenga had consolidated 100 other garbage pickup companies into giant Waste Management, which he took public in 1971. He later bought and expanded Blockbuster Video before selling it to Viacom for $8.4 billion in 1994. Huizenga's latest entrepreneurial effort, Swisher Hygiene, didn't live up to his previous successes, Swisher employees cleaned up bathrooms at restaurants and shops.  Sales hit $176 million in 2014; Huizenga sold the U.S. operations of Swisher to hygiene firm Ecolab for $40 million in late 2015.
