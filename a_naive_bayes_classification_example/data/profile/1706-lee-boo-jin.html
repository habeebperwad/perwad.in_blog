			Lee Boo-Jin is South Korea's richest woman and the eldest daughter of Samsung chairman Lee Kun-Hee. Two thirds of her wealth is tied up in Samsung C&T, which operates a resort and provides a range of business services.  She runs Samsung affiliate Hotel Shilla, a luxury hotel chain, which operates The Shilla, the country's second biggest chain of duty-free shops. In March 2016 it opened its latest retail store in central Seoul in a joint venture with Hyundai Development. Also that month it won local government approval, on the fifth attempt, to build an upscale hotel modeled on a traditional Korean house, or hanok, next to its flagship hotel in central Seoul. Her older brother, Jay Y. Lee, vice chairman of crown jewel Samsung Electronics, faces the trial of the century after being indicted and jailed on bribery charges in February 2017. He denies any wrongdoing.
