			Sidney Kimmel founded popular apparel company the Jones Group more than four decades ago, but his first foray into the fashion world was working at a knitting mill. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners purchased the previously publicly traded company for $2.2 billion in 2014. By the time of the sale, Kimmel had gifted away a big chunk of his Jones Group shares to Johns Hopkins University, which houses the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.  A noted philanthropist, Kimmel's foundation also donated $110 million to Thomas Jefferson University in 2014. The Philadelphia native now spends most of his time in Johnny Carson's former Malibu estate. He also owns production company Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, which produced films such as Adeline and The Kite Runner.
