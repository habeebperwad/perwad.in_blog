			Diego Della Valle took the small shoe factory his grandfather started and turned it into global shoe- and purse-maker Tod's S.p.A. He and his brother, Andrea, share a 61% stake in the business. Diego is the company's chairman and public face, and the one largely credited with committing millions of euros from Tod's to renovate the crumbling Roman Colosseum.  The brothers also share stakes in a number of publicly-traded Italian companies, including scooter-maker Piaggio, multimedia conglomerate RCS MediaGroup and investment bank Mediobanca. In January 2015 the brothers sold the Roger Vivier shoe brand, which they owned personally but licensed to Tod's, for $440 million. They sold a stake in Saks for $362 million when Hudson's Bay bought the department store chain in July 2013. The Della Valles also own Italian soccer team ACF Fiorentina and two yachts, one of which used to belong to John F. Kennedy.
