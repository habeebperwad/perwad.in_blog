			When Americans build houses, Clemmie Spangler makes money. National Gypsum, the drywall manufacturer he owns outright, is the largest private wallboard producer in the U.S., with more than $2 billion in annual sales and 23% of the domestic gypsum board market.  A graduate of Harvard Business School and an Army veteran, he purchased the company in 1995 in the midst of a ten year stint as head of the North Carolina public university system. Spangler started his professional career at his father's construction business. Later, when a family-owned bank began to fail in 1972, he took over, eventually selling the company to North Carolina National Bank for a hefty profit ten years later. in 2013 Spangler was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Harvard. He is also a regular contributor to Teach for America.
