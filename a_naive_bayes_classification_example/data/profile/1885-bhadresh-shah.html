			Engineer from the premier Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur), Bhadresh Shah returns to the Forbes billionaires list after dropping off last year as shares of AIA Engineering, the niche metallurgical company that he founded jumped by two thirds in the past 12 months.  Shah started a small foundry in 1978 and parlayed it into a $275 million (revenue) company selling high-chrome parts for grinding and crushing equipment in 105 countries. AIA is the world's second largest manufacturer of high chromium grinding parts for the cement, mining and power industries.
