			Heidi Horten inherited a fortune from her husband, Helmut Horten, who founded the German department store Horten AG in 1936 and opened the first supermarket in Germany in the late fifties. Heidi met the much, much older Horten in a bar in Austria in 1959, when she was 19. When he died in 1987, he left her a $1 billion fortune.  She's put it to good use. She owns one of the world's largest yachts, the 315-foot Carinthia VII, and lives in a high-security villa on the banks of Austria's Woerthersee lake. In 2008, she sold a 35.5 carat diamond--once a Bavarian crown jewel--for $24 million, at Christie's. In the summer of 2015, she married Austrian nobility Kari Goess whom she had known for 20 years. She currently sits on the board of Helmut Horten Stiftung, a charitable foundation supporting medical research and health care institutions. She also enjoys collecting art and is an avid ice hockey fan.
