			Veteran software entrepreneur and executive Thomas Siebel rebranded his latest company, C3 Energy, in February 2016. Now called C3 IoT, the former clean energy company is chasing the lucrative Internet of Things market.  In September the startup raised $70 million in a round led by TPG Capital. Siebel was once Larry Ellison's top salesman at Oracle. He left in 1990, created software firm Siebel Systems and sold it to Oracle for $5.8 billion in stock in 2006. He founded C3 Energy in 2009 as an energy-analytics firm. The company, funded with $150 million from Siebel and other investors, has inked deals with large utilities and brought on Condoleezza Rice and former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham as directors. Siebel owns a cattle ranch in Montana and invests in real estate.
