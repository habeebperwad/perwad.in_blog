			Media baron Krit Ratanarak's fortune is down partly on declining advertising revenues at his Bangkok Broadcasting & TV, which operates market leader Channel 7. Family's Siam City Cement bought out Mexican giant Cemex's Thai and Bangladesh operations last year in a $53 million deal.  Biggest chunk of his wealth comes from a minority stake in Bank of Ayudhya, country's fifth-largest bank by deposits. The family empire was founded by his late father Chuan who moved to Bangkok at age 6 and got start as a dock labourer.
