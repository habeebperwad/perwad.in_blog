			Cousins Alberto Alcocer and Alberto Cortina married sisters Alicia and Esther Koplowitz, heiresses to one of the largest construction firms in Spain. The cousins, dubbed Los Albertos by the Spanish press, ran their wives' Construcciones y Contratas firm from the early 1970s until 1989, when both marriages fell apart.  Alcocer and Cortina then moved into banking, running Banco Zaragozano. They sold their combined 40% stake to Barclays in 2004. They continue to invest together today. Each owns a 50% of Alcor Holding, which has stakes in Grupo Empresarial ENCE, the largest eucalyptus pulp producer in Europe, and Actividades de Construccion y Servicios, another construction firm. Alcocer owns several ranches in Cadiz and Toledo, Spain, along with houses in Paris and Madrid.
