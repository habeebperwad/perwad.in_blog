			He made his fortune in the oil business, selling his Bakken oil fields to XTO Energy in 2008 for $1.85 billion. After that, Tim Headington plunged into a bigger passion: moviemaking. Teamed with legendary film producer Graham King, he bankrolled some hugely expensive but Oscar-winning films like "Hugo" and "Rango" and found big success with smaller stakes in Brad Pitt's "World War Z" and Best Picture "Argo.  " Headington has since backed away from the movies for now, and is instead dedicated to making his mark on Dallas -- having assembled a huge land position downtown and recently completed a lavish expansion of his boutique hotel Joule. Headington has grand dreams for bigger hotel/condo projects. In 2012 his own Miami condo sold for $25 million. Inspired by his geologist father, Headington founded Headington Oil in 1978. He stayed under the radar until that 2008 sale. Still investing in oil, the big dip in his net worth this year is due to the oil price bust. After Oklahoma University, Headington earned graduate degrees in theology and psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary. His nascent Headington Institute aims to give psychological training to humanitarian relief workers worldwide.
