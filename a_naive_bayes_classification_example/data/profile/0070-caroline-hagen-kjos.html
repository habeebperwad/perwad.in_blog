			Caroline Hagen Kjos became chairman of the family's Canica AS in 2014. The Swiss resident also assumed 97.5% ownership of the holding company at that time. Her father Stein Erik Hagen founded discount supermarket Rimi with his father in the 1970s.  It merged with Sweden's ICA group in 1998 and later combined with Dutch retailer Ahold. Hagen eventually sold his stake, forming Canica AS with the proceeds. Canica AS now has various investments across Scandinavia, including goods manufacturer Orkla ASA and hardware store chain Jernia.
