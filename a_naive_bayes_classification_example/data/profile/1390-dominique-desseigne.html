			Dominique Desseigne lords over one of France's largest casino groups, Groupe Lucien Barri√®re, which owns 34 casinos, 16 luxury hotels and more than 120 bars and restaurants. Collectively the group employs more than 6,000 people and brings in nearly $1.3 billion in annual revenues.  Desseigne's late wife, Diane Barriere, inherited the company from her father; she was badly injured in a 1995 plane crash that left her confined to a wheel chair and respiratory equipment. She died in 2001. Desseigne, who took the reins in 1997 and became CEO the year she died, owns 60% of the company while France's financial services giant, Fimalac, owns the remaining 40%. Desseigne has two young children from his marriage to Diane.
