			The grandson of Italian immigrants, Rick Caruso built two of the country's most successful shopping centers: The Grove and The Americana at Brand in Los Angeles. His privately held firm, Caruso Affiliated, is now redeveloping downtown Pacific Palisades and building a 5-star beachfront resort in Montecito, near Santa Barbara.  In January 2017, Caruso conceded to the Los Angeles city council to lower the height of a planned residential tower near Beverly Hills from 240 to 185 feet. The son of Dollar-Rent-a-Car founder Henry Caruso, Rick began his career as a lawyer and started his real estate firm in 1992. He served as president of the Los Angeles Police Commission and commissioner for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He has been pondering a mayoral run for years. In June 2015, Caruso and his wife, Tina, donated $25 million to the University of Southern California to fund research on hearing loss and related diseases, after doctors there improved their teenage daughter's hearing with a new device.
