			Russia's wealthiest woman, Elena Baturina, whose husband was the longtime mayor of Moscow, sold almost all of her assets including a  construction company called Inteko and a cement factory in 2011. The Russian government seized land she owned in an exclusive area of Moscow.  She filed a lawsuit in Russia, demanding $1 billion in compensation but didn't get anything. She now lives in London and invests mostly in real estate in other parts of Europe and the U.S.  She owns hotels in Dublin, Austria, the Czech Republic as well as Russia and she bought two commercial properties in Brooklyn near the Barclays Center in 2015. She has also been putting money into solar energy projects in Southern Europe.
