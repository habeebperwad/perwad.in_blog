			Yuriy Kosiuk heads MHP, the Ukraine's biggest producer of poultry. He studied food process engineering at Kiev Food Industry Institute. He got his start importing furniture and Turkmenistan gas. He then began trading grain after the Soviet Union's collapse and eventually moved into poultry.  He took MHP, the precursor of which he founded in 1998 with 10 employees, public in 2008. Kosiuk pays himself handsomely through dividends and has used the cash to buy himself airplanes, a helicopter, a yacht and several cars including a Lamborghini.
