			Walter Scott began his career at construction company Peter Kiewit in his native Omaha, Nebraska, where he rose to the rank of CEO in 1979. He owned a stake in Kiewit spinoff MFS Communications, which sold to WorldCom in 1996 for a reported $15.4 billion.  The bulk of Scott's fortune today is held in shares of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utilities company he bought in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway. A longtime friend of Warren Buffett, Scott serves on the board of Berkshire Hathaway. He has been a big benefactor to the University of Nebraska, Omaha and Colorado State University. UNO's Pacific Campus was renamed the Scott Campus in July 2016 and Scott gave a $53 million gift to CSU in November 2016.
