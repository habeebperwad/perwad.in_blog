			The son of a traveling salesman, Murdock, who is dyslexic, dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and worked at a gas station before being drafted into the Army in 1943. After the war he made a small profit buying and selling a diner; later, he developed property in Arizona. Through Castle & Cooke holdings, he still owns a collection of residential and commercial properties in Arizona, California, Florida, North Carolina and Hawaii. The U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into Murdock's Dole Foods in April 2016 following a listeria outbreak caused by its packaged salads that left at least 1 person dead and 19 others sickened earlier in the year. Murdock has vowed to live until age 125 (he's now 93) and has donated heavily to longevity research.
