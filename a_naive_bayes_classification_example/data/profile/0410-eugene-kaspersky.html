He became interested in computer security in 1989 when his computer was infected with the "Cascade" virus.  By then a young software engineer, he managed to get rid of it. Today his Kaspersky Lab protects some 400 million users, and is used by 270,000 companies around the world. Kaspersky Lab sponsors Scuderia Ferrari, one of the most successful Formula One teams.
