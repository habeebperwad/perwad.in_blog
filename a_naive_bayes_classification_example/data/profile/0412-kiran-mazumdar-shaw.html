			India's richest self-made woman, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, returns to the Forbes billionaires ranks on rising shares of her listed Biocon, which have more than doubled in the past year. The company, Asia's largest insulin producer, is aiming for a 10% share of the global market.  Last year it launched a disposable insulin pen in Japan with partner FUJIFILM Pharma. In other good news, biosimilar drugs to treat certain cancers, codeveloped with U.S.-based Mylan, were accepted by both European and American regulators for review; Biocon also opened a $250 million insulin factory in Malaysia's Johor region. News of these milestones lifted the stock. Mazumdar Shaw was awarded the Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la LÃ©gion d'Honneur, France's highest civilian honor, for her outstanding contribution to bioscience.
