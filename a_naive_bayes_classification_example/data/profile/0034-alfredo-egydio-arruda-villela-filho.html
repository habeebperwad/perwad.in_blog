			Alfredo Egydio de Arruda Villela Filho belongs to one of Brazil's oldest banking families. He is the largest individual shareholder of Itausa, the bank's holding company. Alfredo's great-grandfather founded Itau, one of Brazil's largest banks, which merged with Unibanco in 2008 to form Itau-Unibanco.  Business acumen runs in the family: Alfredo's grandfather founded publicly-traded Duratex, a Brazilian maker of wood paneling and bathroom fixtures, which Alfredo also owns a stake of.  Alfredo holds a degree in mechanical engineering. He is on the board of Itausa, Itau-Unibanco, Itautec, Elekeiroz, and Duratex. With his younger sister, Ana Lucia, Alfredo supports the Alana Institute, a non-profit organization they co-founded in Sao Paulo 1994 to promote education and culture for children. The siblings lost their parents in a plane crash in 1982, and were raised by their aunt, Maria de Lourdes Egydio Villela, a former billionaire thanks to her shares in Itau-Unibanco, which she's since donated to her sons Rodolfo and Ricardo Villela Marino.
