			Alexander Ponomarenko and his billionaire partner, Alexander Skorobogatko, have been moving from sea ports and banking into airport construction. In 2013 the partners, together with Arkady Rotenberg, a judo partner of President Vladimir Putin, won a tender to develop part of Sheremetyevo, the state-owned airport outside Moscow.  The project includes a new terminal for 20 million passengers, a building that will hold 380,000 tons of cargo, a refueling complex and a tunnel connecting the airport's southern and northern complexes. The partners have already invested $1 billion in the project. The partners also joined with Rotenberg to found TPS Real Estate, which owns more than half of the real estate in Ocean Plaza, Kiev's biggest shopping center. The two Alexanders first set up a small perfume factory together in the Ukraine and then founded a bank in Moscow. They began buying up shares in cargo companies around a bit port following the 1998 Russian financial crisis; they combined them to form Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port, which became the largest port in Russia.
