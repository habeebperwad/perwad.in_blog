			T. Denny Sanford owns First Premier Bank, which specializes in offering credit cards to high-risk borrowers. The Sioux Falls-based bank has just 12 branches, but it's one of the largest issuers of Visa and Mastercards -- many of which have steep interest rates and low credit limits.  A major philanthropist, Sanford says he wants to die broke. But he faces a rare problem: He can't get rid of his fortune fast enough. Thanks to the hefty dividends he reaps from First Premier, Sanford is no closer to bankruptcy than when he began, despite giving more than $1.6 billion to charity including nearly $1 billion to Sanford Health -- a group of 43 non-profit hospitals formerly called the Sioux Valley Health System. His children's education initiatives include Sanford Harmony, a program designed to reduce friction between students in pre-K through sixth grade classrooms. Sanford says he hopes the program, which promotes positive relationships between boys and girls, will reduce America's divorce rate by 50% within the next 50 years.
