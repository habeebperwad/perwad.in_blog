			Sukanto Tanoto's conglomerate, Royal Golden Eagle (RGE), completed a $1.1 billion privatization of Bracell, one of the world's largest producers of specialty cellulose, used in everything from baby wipes and ice cream to textiles, in 2016. His Woodfibre, a subsidiary of RGE's Pacific Oil & Gas, is going ahead with plans to construct a liquefied natural gas terminal, the group's first energy project in British Columbia, Canada.  RGE also has interests in paper and pulp and palm oil. The eldest of 7 boys, Tanoto dropped out of school at age 17 to start his own business. He says he taught himself English by reading Readers' Digest, Life and Newsweek.
