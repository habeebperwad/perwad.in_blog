			While the bulk of his fortune comes from real estate, shopping mall magnate Edward Debartolo Jr. is best known as one of the most successful NFL owners in history. At his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August 2016, the former San Francisco 49ers owner: "Truly I have lived the American dream. " Under Debartolo's ownership, the 49ers won five championships during the 1980's and 1990's. In 1998 he pleaded guilty to a felony, admitting he failed to report a bribe request that then-Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards made when DeBartolo was trying to get a riverboat casino license. The NFL fined him $250,000 and suspended him from running the 49ers for one year. In 2000, six years after their father's death, he and his sister Denise York finalized the separation of their father's estate. Denise became the owner of the 49ers while DeBartolo got full ownership of the family's real estate holdings. DeBartolo now runs a property development and investment firm based in Florida and owns shares in publicly-traded Simon Property Group, which acquired DeBartolo Realty for $1.5 billion in stock in 1996.
