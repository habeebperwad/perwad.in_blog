			A former communist committee leader in Moscow, Andrei Guriev became an enthusiastic capitalist in the 1990s. Former billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky tapped him to be his deputy director at financial holding company, Menatep Group; he eventually rose to chairman of its Apatit subsidiary.  After 2001, Guriev began buying up fertilizer processing plants and combined them into holding company PhosAgro, at which point Khodorovsky awarded him a small stake. While Khodorkovsky spent a decade in prison, Guriev led a management buyout to acquire control of PhosAgro. In 2011 PhosAgro raised over 500 million dollars  in an IPO. Deputy chairman of PhosAgro (his son is CEO), he and his family own a 48% stake in the company.
