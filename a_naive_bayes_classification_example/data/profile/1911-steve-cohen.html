			One of the most successful hedge fund managers ever, Steve Cohen now presides over his $11 billion family office, Point 72 Asset Management. It was formerly a hedge fund firm, SAC Capital, which was forced to return outside money in the wake of an insider-trading scandal that cost Cohen $1.8 billion in penalties.  Cohen is now preparing for January 2018, when a two-year ban on managing non-family money expires. An avid poker player and son of a dress manufacturer who worked in Manhattan's garment district, Cohen started trading with $7,000 that was supposed to be part of his tuition payment at the Wharton School. He ultimately developed his own rapid-fire style of trading which won him praise at Gruntal, his first foray into Wall Street. By 1992, he founded SAC with $20 million of his own money. It became one of the largest and most successful hedge funds in history and charged some of the industry's richest fees, which helped Cohen amass a $1 billion art collection. Current holdings include a 4% stake in hot fintech IPO Square and a $250 million trading account with crowdsourced algorithmic trading platform Quantopian.
