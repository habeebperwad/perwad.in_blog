			Bernie Ecclestone took Formula One from a niche racing competition to a global phenomenon over a four decade career. But the man dubbed "F1 Supremo" by the British tabloids finally gave up the helm in January 2017, moving from CEO to chairman emeritus after Liberty Media Corp.  acquired the group of companies that oversee the prominent racing series for $4.4 billion. Born the son of a trawler captain in Suffolk, Ecclestone built one of the U.K.'s largest used car dealerships after World War II and bought the Brabham racing team in 1971. Seven years later he became president of the chassis builder's union as the group battled F1's governing body over teams' share of revenues and the sport's now-lucrative TV rights. He eventually took control of F1's governance and lorded over the business despite selling most of his stake in the late 1990s. Ecclestone was accused of bribing German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky in the heat of the 2006 sale of the F1 group of companies to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. While Gribkowsky was sentenced to eight and a half years behind bars, Ecclestone ultimately settled charges against him for $100 million. He met former model Slavica, who was his wife for 24 years until their 2009 divorce, while jetting from race to race in the 1980s. His fortune includes cash held in trusts for her and the couple's daughters, Petra and Tamara.
