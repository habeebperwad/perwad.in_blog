			Ananda Krishnan lost his spot in 2017 as Malaysia's second-richest person amid falling shares of his telecom outfit Maxis and oilfield-services-provider Bumi Armada. He's now No. 3. In 2016 he agreed to merge his debt-laden Indian telecom firm Aircel with Indian billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications.  But India's Supreme Court threatened to auction Aircel's spectrum because Krishnan hasn't responded to summons in a long-running federal investigation of how he had acquired Aircel. (Krishnan has denied any wrongdoing). In another setback, Krishnan's key lieutenant, Augustus Ralph Marshall, who is also embroiled in the same case, has left the group in a reportedly acrimonious parting. And Saudi Telecom is said to be mulling the sale of its 16.2% stake in Maxis. Krishnan has an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. His only son is a Buddhist monk in Thailand.
