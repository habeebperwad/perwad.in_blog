			Born in Sudan and now a U.K. citizen, Mohammed (Mo) Ibrahim founded Celtel International, one of the first mobile phone companies serving Africa and the Middle East. He sold it to Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Company for $3.4 billion in 2005 and pocketed $1.4 billion.  Since then, he's focused on fighting corrupt leadership in Africa through the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, directed by his daughter, Hadeel. The award, which recognizes good governance in Africa, has been given out only four times in the 8 years since it was announced. One recipient of its $5 million Ibrahim Prize was Namibia's outgoing president, Hifikepunye Pohamba, in 2014.  The foundation also publishes the well-known Ibrahim Index of African Governance, which ranks countries by rule of law, economic opportunity and human rights. Ibrahim owns the majority of assets in Satya Capital, which invests in African businesses.
