			Taha Mikati founded telecom operator Investcom with his brother, former Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, during Lebanon's civil war in the 1980s. They later expanded into several African countries before selling their stake in 2006 to MTN Group of South Africa for $3.6 billion in cash and stock.  Through their holding company, M1, the brothers still own just under 10% of MTN, one of their most valuable assets. Mikati's son Azmi, a Columbia University engineering grad, runs the day-to-day business. M1 Group has investments in real estate and apparel company Faconnable. In 2012, M1 Group bought a stake in U.K. supermarket chain J Sainsbury.
