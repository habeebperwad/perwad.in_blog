			John A. Sobrato's mother, who arrived from Italy not speaking English, started the family's real estate empire in the 1950s, when she sold her late husband's restaurant and bought property south of San Francisco.  Sobrato began selling homes in Palo Alto while he was still a student at Santa Clara University and later worked with his mother to develop industrial properties. He founded his own company in 1979. The Sobrato Organization now owns 7.5 million square feet of office space across Silicon Valley, including the headquarters of Apple, Yahoo and Netflix, plus 6,700 apartments along the West Coast. Sobrato is board chairman, and his son, John M. Sobrato, is CEO. Both of them have committed to donating at least half of their fortunes to charity. The family has given away nearly $380 million, primarily to Silicon Valley charities. In January 2017, Sobrato and his wife announced a $100 million gift to his alma mater, Santa Clara University, to build a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) facility. The Sobratos have previously donated more than $20 million toward projects on the campus.
