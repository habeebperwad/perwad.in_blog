			Wireless pioneer Craig McCaw has stayed out of the limelight since stepping down as chairman of telecom operator Clearwire in 2010, two years before it was acquired by Sprint. Now he chairs intellectual property firm Pendrell, which has sued big tech firms for alleged patent infringement.  After reaching an undisclosed settlement with Amazon in July 2015, Pendrell unsuccessfully went up against Apple, Google and Samsung over the same charges; a U.S. District court in Texas cleared the tech giants in separate cases in November 2015. In 1966 McCaw and his brothers took over their dad's cable-TV business. They sold McCaw Cellular to AT&T in 1994 for $12.6 billion.
