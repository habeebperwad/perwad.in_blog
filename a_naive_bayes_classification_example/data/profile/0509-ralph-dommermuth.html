			Ralph Dommermuth leads United Internet AG, one of Germany's largest Internet access providers, which serves mostly home users and small- to medium-sized enterprises and also provides web hosting, storage and email services.  Dommermuth launched United's predecessor company, 1&1 AG, in 1988 with a borrowed desk and $285,000 saved from working as a computer salesman. The company provided tech-savvy marketing services for small software and telecommunications suppliers, and eventually landed clients such as IBM, Compaq and Deutsche Telekom. It went public on Germany's stock exchange for high-tech companies, the Neuer Markt, in 1998. Dommermuth, who now owns 40%, made expansion bets in 2014: United paid about $750 million in cash to up its stake in Germany's second-largest fiber-optic network, Versatel GmbH, from 25% to 100%, and spent an additional $580 million for a 10.7% stake in incubator Rocket Internet AG. An avid sailor, he and his company sponsored the United Internet Team Germany in the 2007 America's Cup. Dommermuth is married to the model and fashion designer Judith Berger and has one adult son from his first marriage.
