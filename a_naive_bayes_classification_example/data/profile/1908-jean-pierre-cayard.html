Jean-Pierre joined in 1970 and turned it into one of France's largest spirits groups, with a huge portfolio of international brands.  Among them are its three "millionaire" brands, which sell more than a million 9-liter cases each: Porto Cruz, a leading Port brand; Label 5, among the top 10 best-selling scotch whiskey brands; and Poliakov, France's top-selling vodka brand. The private company, which he owns, has 24 production sites throughout the world and sells product in 110 countries. His wife, Edith, and daughter Sylvia also work for the company.
