			James France inherited an estimated 36% of Nascar, the stock car racing business founded by his father, William France Sr., in 1948. Business is strong, thanks to 10-year TV deals with Fox and NBC -- worth a combined $8.2 billion in rights -- that began in 2015. The company implemented a new charter system in 2016 that gives some owners long-term guarantees that their teams will be granted automatic spots in races.  France also serves as chairman of Nascar's sister company, publicly-traded International Speedway Corp. The company operates 13 racetracks that, in all, hold nearly a million seats. His niece, Lesa France Kennedy, is International Speedway's CEO, while nephew Brian France is Nascar's chief executive.
