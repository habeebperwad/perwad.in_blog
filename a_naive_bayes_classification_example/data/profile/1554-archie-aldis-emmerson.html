He and his family are also the nation's third-largest landowner.  Emmerson founded Sierra Pacific with his father, Curly, in 1949. He took the lumber products company public 20 years later and then private again in 1973. His sons, George and Mark, have taken over as president and chairman, respectively. The company has been granting scholarships to the children of its employees for nearly four decades.
