			Gabe Newell runs Valve Corporation, which plays a big role in PC game sales through its Steam digital game store; some liken it to the iTunes of video games. Through Steam, Valve sells licenses to 125 million users of its own and other developers' titles and collects a percentage of the sales.  Newell has led Valve since he cofounded it in 1998 with former Microsoft colleague Mike Harrington; the company found initial success with games like Half-Life and Portal. Forbes estimates that Newell owns just over half the company, which operates out of Bellevue, Washington and is known for its flat organization and what some call "Valve Time," a tendency to postpone releases of its creations until long after their initial announcement. In April 2016 the private company ventured into new territory with the release of Vive, a Virtual Reality headset developed with Chinese consumer electronics company HTC, which has become one of the more popular brands in the booming VR-market.
