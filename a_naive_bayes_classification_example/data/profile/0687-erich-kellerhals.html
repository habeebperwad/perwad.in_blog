			Erich and Helga Kellerhals founded the electronics retail giant Media-Saturn GmbH with two business partners (Walter Gunz and Leopold Stiefel) in 1979. The very first Media Markt opened its doors that year in an industrial park in Munich, with the aim of offering a broad selection of brand products at permanently low prices.  In 1988, the founders sold a 54% stake to Kaufhof, which later merged with retail giant Metro. Still holding close to 22% of Media-Saturn and maintaining veto rights, Erich Kellerhals has had a strained relationship with Metro over the governance and operation of Media-Saturn, resulting in extensive legal battles. In March 2016, Metro announced plans to split off Media-Saturn -- which has over 1,000 stores in 15 countries and generates around $23 billion in annual revenue -- into a separate joint-stock corporation with its own public listing. Erich and Helga live in the hills of Salzburg, Austria, where they own a fine-dining restaurant. Via their management holding company, Convergenta Invest und Beteiligungs GmbH in Salzburg, they also invest in shopping malls and commercial real estate in Austria, Germany and Poland. The couple founded Convergenta in 2004.
