			Howard Jenkins is an heir to the Publix super markets fortune. He sits on the board of the company, which his father George Jenkins (d. 1996), founded in 1930 in Winter Haven, Florida. Publix is the largest employee-owned company in the U. S. Although the business is private, its board sets a stock price each quarter based on an independent valuation. Jenkins spent 11 years at the helm of Publix, taking over as chairman and CEO in 1990 and leading expansion into other southern states. Like many executives at Publix (even family members), he started as a lowly bag boy. He rose to equipment buyer and vice president of research before becoming CEO.
