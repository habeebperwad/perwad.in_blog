			Todd Christopher founded hair care company Vogue International in 1987. The  fourth generation in a family of hair dressers, Christopher started off working in salons before using his savings to start his own product business.  He initially sold Pro-Vitamin hair treatment capsules out of the trunk of his car. In 2014 he sold 49% of the business -- which owns hair care brands like OGX, Pro-Vitamin, FX and Maui -- to the Carlyle Group for $400 million. Then, two years later, Christopher and Carlyle sold 100% of Vogue International to Johnson & Johnson for $3.3 billion.
