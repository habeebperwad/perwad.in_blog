			Radovan Vitek agreed to make his biggest acquisition to date in January 2017, when his CPI Property Group said it would acquire 11 shopping centers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania for about $700 million from CBRE Global Investors, a real estate investment firm.  Vitek got his start during Slovakia's voucher privatization in the 1990s, then moved to the Czech Republic in 1997, where he took over a cooperative and turned the headquarters into a luxe hotel, launching his commercial real estate career. Besides a home in Prague, Vitek owns a 260-acre estate in Surrey, England that formerly belonged to ex-Beatle Ringo Starr; a house in the Swiss Alps, and a villa on St. Bart's Island in the West Indies.
