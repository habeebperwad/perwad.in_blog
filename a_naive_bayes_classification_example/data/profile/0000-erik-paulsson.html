			At the age of 17, in 1957, Erik Paulsson and his younger brother Mats founded a waste management company to service the local farmers in the south of Sweden. The company, later named PEAB, expanded to construction in 1970, the industry it's known for today.  PEAB has more than 14,000 employees and 2014 revenues exceeded $5 billion. In 1989 it went public in Stockholm. While Mats and his family still control the company, Erik has divested into spin-offs of several PEAB property management entities. His most valuable holdings are Wihlborgs Fastigheter, Catena and Fabege, all real estate companies traded on the Stockholm stock exchange. In deciding who would get what in the division of PEAB, the brothers reportedly flipped a coin.
