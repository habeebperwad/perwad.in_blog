			Despite the oil bust, in 2015 Jeff Hildebrand gave each of the 1,400 employees at Hilcorp Energy a $100,000 bonus to thank them for their help doubling the size of his company in five years and making it the biggest privately held oil and gas company in America.  Hildebrand founded Hilcorp in 1990 with the idea of buying up old oilfields and using technology to squeeze out more profits. In Alaska, his Hilcorp has been acquiring and reviving mature fields in the Cook Inlet and the North Slope. Hildebrand's biggest payday came in 2011, when he turned a $100 million investment in the Eagle Ford shale into $1.8 billion with a sale to Marathon Oil. A horse lover, Hildebrand has built a polo field on his ranch in Aspen and also bought a 957-acre property there that used to belong to John Denver. Hildebrand also serves on the boards of the Greater Houston Community Foundation, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.
