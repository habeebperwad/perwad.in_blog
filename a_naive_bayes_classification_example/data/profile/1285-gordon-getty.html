			Gordon Getty, son of the late oilman J.Paul Getty, led the sale of his family's Getty Oil to Texaco for $10.1 billion in 1984, and followed by orchestrating the breakup of the family trust. An opera and wine aficionado, Getty is a partner in Odette Estate winery in Napa Valley.  In April 2016, President Obama attended Getty's annual Democratic candidate fundraiser at his San Francisco home. The Getty family has faced numerous tragedies: The wife of Gordon's brother J. Paul Jr. died of a heroin overdose; J. Paul Jr.'s son was kidnapped by Italian gangsters, but only after they chopped off his ear did the boy's grandfather pay the ransom money, which he lent to his son with interest. In March 2015, Gordon's son Andrew Rork Getty was found dead in his Beverly Hills mansion at age 47; despite initial suspicion of foul play, authorities indicated his death was tied to medical issues and an unhealthy lifestyle. In April 2016, Gordon Getty filed a claim with the California Superior Court for his share of his son's estate.
