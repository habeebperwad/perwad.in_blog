			Paul Fireman bought the U.S. distribution rights for a small British shoe company in 1979, turned it into Reebok and rode the sneakers craze amid the 1980s aerobics trend. Nike pulled ahead in the early 1990s, and shareholders demanded that Fireman step down in 1996. He eventually did, but he returned in 1999 and revived the business before selling it to Adidas for $3.8 billion in 2005, a deal that earned him $600 million.  Fireman has since continued to invest in sports and owns Liberty National Golf Course, a $250 million country club built on a New Jersey landfill overlooking the Statue of Liberty. The club is one of the most exclusive courses in the world, with members reportedly paying $500,000 to join.
