			Canberra native Terry Snow bought a 50-year lease on the capital's airport for $65 million back in 1998. Since then he's transformed it from barely more than a tin shed to an international airport. Developing the surplus land has been the key to the airport's success.  He now has a $2.6 billion portfolio that includes an office park, a hotel, a shopping center and a host of services for workers.
