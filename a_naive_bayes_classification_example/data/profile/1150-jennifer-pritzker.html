			The world's only known transgender billionaire, Jennifer Pritzker announced in 2013 that she would live her life as a woman. Formerly known as James, the retired Army lieutenant colonel founded the Pritzker Military Library in Chicago in 2003, and through her Tawani Foundation, works to preserve American military history.   Jennifer is one of 11 billionaire members of the extended Pritzker family, which sold its controlling stake in industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for $4.5 billion in 2008. Her grandfather, A.N. Pritzker (d. 1986), with his sons Jay (d. 1999), Robert (d. 2011) and Donald (D. 1972), created Marmon and hotel chain Hyatt. Jennifer is CEO of private wealth management firm Tawani Enterprises in Chicago and still owns 1.7% of Hyatt stock. Some of the proceeds from her portion of the Marmon payout have gone towards amassing properties around her hometown of Chicago.
