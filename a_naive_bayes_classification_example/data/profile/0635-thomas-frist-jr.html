			Thomas Frist Jr., a former Air Force flight surgeon, founded Hospital Corp. of America with his father in 1968 and took it public for the third time in 2011 after two management buyouts. His brother, Bill Frist, was Senate majority leader.  Frist Jr. doesn't have an executive position at HCA, but his sons Thomas III and William are board members. HCA owns and operates about 166 hospitals and 115 freestanding surgery centers in 20 U.S. states, London and Cixi, China. In April 2016, HCA settled a lengthy shareholders lawsuit for $215 million stemming from the IPO in 2011, and also agreed to renew its governance structure. Investors argued that HCA had breached fiduciary duty by not properly revealing falling Medicaid revenues. HCA and its board members deny wrongdoing.
