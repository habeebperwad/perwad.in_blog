			Arne Wilhelmsen launched Royal Caribbean Cruises in 1969. Over the years, it pioneered many innovations including the first cruise line to offer rock climbing, ice skating and surfing at sea. It's now one of the largest cruise ship companies in the world with a fleet of 25. The Harvard grad retired more than a decade ago, with his son Alex taking his place on the Royal Caribbean board of directors in 2003. He also shifted most of the ownership to his three sons.  Wilhelmsen pocketed at least $500 million in 2008 when China Oilfield Services acquired Awilco Offshore, in which he had 40% stake, for $2.5 billion. He and his family also own one of Norway's biggest property developers, Linstow.
