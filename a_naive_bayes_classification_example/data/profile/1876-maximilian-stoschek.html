			Maximilian Stoschek is the son of Michael Stoschek, who has led family-owned autoparts company Brose.  The grandson of Max Brose, founder of the namesake German auto-parts maker, Michael Stoschek took over the company in 1971 at age 23. Under his leadership, Brose evolved from a national manufacturer into a world market leader in electrical and mechanical components and integrated systems that are largely invisible to vehicle drivers.  Brose bills itself as the world's fifth-largest family-owned automotive supplier.  Approximately 24,000 employees work for the company at 60 locations in 23 countries. Annual revenues top $6.4 billion. Maximilian, who owns an estimated 20% of Brose, is the CEO of helicopter charter company BHS Helicopterservice. Together with his father Michael, he sits on the supervisory board of the basketball team Brose Bamberg.
