Alain's grandfather, Marcel Merieux, a laboratory aide to Louis Pasteur, founded the institute in 1897. Alain founded BioMerieux, one of the firm's publicly traded arms, which specializes in diagnostic tests for infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis.  BioMerieux currently operates in 150 countries and has more than 9,000 employees. The firm's other publicly-traded subsidiary, Transgene, develops vaccines to combat infectious diseases. Alain's oldest son Rodolphe was killed in 1996 at age 27 when TWA Flight 800 crashed in Long Island. His second son, Christophe, who was expected to take over the family business, died of cardiac failure in 2006 at age 39. His third son, Alexandre, who shares the fortune, was named CEO of BioMerieux in 2014. In 2015 Alain was made Grand Officer in the French Legion of Honour, one of the most prestigious civilian honors in France, for his outstanding service in the global health industry.
