			As cofounder and cochairman of Oaktree Capital Management, Howard Marks has seen his Los Angeles-based investment firm develop into a leading distressed-debt investor. Marks started the firm in 1995 after he, cochairman Bruce Karsh and four other colleagues left TCW (formerly known as Trust Company of the West), where they had organized one of the first-ever distressed debt funds for a mainstream financial institution.  The firm has since grown from managing $5 billion at its conception to $100 billion in current assets, more than half of which is invested in distressed or corporate debt. Marks, who started writing investment memos to clients in 1990, is known in the investment community for the highly regarded missives, which detail strategies and insight into the economy. In recent years he has also become a prolific buyer and seller of high-end properties, with real estate in New York, Beverly Hills and Hawaii.
