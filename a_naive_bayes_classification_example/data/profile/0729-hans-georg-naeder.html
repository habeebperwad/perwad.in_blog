			Hans-Georg Naeder heads one of Germany's largest orthopedic device makers, Otto Bock Group. The family business has worked with the Paralympics since 1988, producing hockey sledges and custom prosthetics for skiers, snowboarders and sprinters.  Since taking the reins from his father at age 28, Naeder has expanded the staff more than five-fold to over 7,600 worldwide. The group operates sales and service branches in 50 countries and generates annual revenue of around $1.1 billion. Otto Bock was founded in 1919 by Naeder's grandfather (after whom the company is named). Naeder lives in Duderstadt, Germany with his wife and two daughters. An avid sportsman, he owns the 46-meter-long sailing yacht Pink Gin, which he helmed to victory in the New Zealand Millennium Cup in 2007.
