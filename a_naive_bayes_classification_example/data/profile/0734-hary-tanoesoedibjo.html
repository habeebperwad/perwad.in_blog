			Hary Tanoesoedibjo is a partner of Donald Trump's and is doing his best to emulate the 45th president. While he constructs two luxury, Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia, he's busily laying the groundwork for a run at the Indonesian presidency.  He founded his political party, Perindo, almost immediately after a brief run as a vice-presidential candidate in Indonesia's 2014 election. Tanoesoedibjo got his start by building a media empire in the 2000s--he still owns more than 60 TV stations, as well as a newspaper and radio stations--before moving into real estate and partnering with Trump.
