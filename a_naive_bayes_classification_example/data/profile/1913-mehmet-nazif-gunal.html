			Mehmet Nazif Gunal (MNG) received his degree in Civil Engineering in 1971 and established his own construction company. Today his businesses are gathered under the roof of MNG Holding, which he owns outright.  The most important source of his wealth: 10 five-star hotels, concentrated in Turkey's most important tourism regions -- Antalya, Bodrum and Istanbul -- with a combined bed capacity of over 8,500; five of them are managed by MNG. Operating under the World of Wonders brand name, the WoW Kremlin Palace and the WoW Topkapi Palace, situated in Antalya, are architecturally exact replicas of the Kremlin and Topkapi palaces. In 2014, Gunal bought 90% of a gold mine in Liberia from the Liberian government. MNG has ongoing construction projects in Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Georgia, Libya and Dubai, as well as in Turkey.
