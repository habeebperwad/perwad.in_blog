			Real estate tycoon Neil Bluhm grew up in a cramped Chicago apartment, not far from where his grandparents arrived from Lithuania with nothing. They got a horse-drawn wagon and took other immigrants to warehouses full of clothes, where they could buy, say, a $3 coat on credit.  Bluhm's grandparents collected the money for the warehouses, earning a small commission. Bluhm, who was raised by his mother on her bookkeeper's salary, made partner at a Chicago law firm by age 31. With three kids and a big mortgage on his house, he quit the legal world and partnered with his college roommate in hopes of striking it rich in real estate. "My credit card was my net worth," he tells Forbes. "But that's America. It's a great country." Now he owns several of Chicago's most prominent buildings -- along with real estate and casinos around the country. Bluhm is a minority owner of both the Chicago Bulls and the Chicago White Sox.
