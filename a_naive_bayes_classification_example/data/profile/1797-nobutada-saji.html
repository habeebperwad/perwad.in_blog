			Nobutada Saji is chairman of drinks powerhouse Suntory Holdings, which bought U.S. Beam, purveyor of Jim Beam and Maker's Mark bourbon, for $16 billion in 2014. He stepped down as president that year, turning the reins over to a non-family member for first time since the business was founded in 1899. Saji's nephew, Nobuhiro Torii, a great grandson of Suntory's founder and a member of the family's fourth generation, was promoted to chief operating officer and executive vice president of Suntory Holdings in 2016.
