			For John Paulson, 2016 was another down year as merger strategies fell sharply due to a major holding in pharmaceutical stocks like Mylan, Allergan and Teva Pharmaceuticals. The billionaire saw his net worth drop by nearly $2 billion in a year as of February 2017. Two bright spots for Paulson in 2016 were the strong performance in his credit strategies, and positive unrealized returns from his bet on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Paulson, a supporter of President Donald Trump, is famed for betting against subprime mortgages at the peak of the 2007 credit bubble and making billions. Since then, he has suffered several wrong way trades, including bets on a Greek recovery and the island of Puerto Rico, in addition to a turn in performance from his pharma heavy merger funds. A Queens native like Trump, Paulson graduated NYU after having visited his family in Ecuador, where he shipped children's clothing to his father to sell at Bloomingdale's. After earning a degree at Harvard Business School, he had stints at several at firms including the Boston Consulting Group and Bear Stearns, striking out on his own in 1994 founding Paulson & Co. with only $2 million.
