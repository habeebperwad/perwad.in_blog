			Len Ainsworth gave his large stake in Aristocrat Leisure to his seven sons and wife more than 20 years ago; he's entitled to some proceeds if they sell. He founded Aristocrat in 1953 but stepped aside in 1994 after a cancer scare; it's now the world's second-biggest gaming-machine company.  He started a similar company, Ainsworth Game Technology, the following year at age 72. He remains an executive director after selling his majority stake to Australian gaming giant Novomatic.
