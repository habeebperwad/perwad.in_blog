			Real estate and metals moguls, brothers David and Simon Reuben, sold 49% of their data center business, GlobalSwitch, to consortium of Chinese investors called Elegant Jubilee for nearly $3 billion in cash in December 2016. Global Switch plans to add another 10 data centers, primarily in Asia.  The brothers hold all the debt on the Plaza Hotel in NYC and the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. They also own a controlling interest in a 788-berth marina in San Remo, Italy. After growing up in the UK--David traded metals, Simon imported carpets and bought real estate--they joined together in Transworld, a metals trader that invested in Russia and Kazakhstan in the 1990s. It reportedly controlled as much as 7% of the world's aluminum trade at one time. They sold that business and focused on building a real estate portfolio. Their Reuben Foundation funds health care and educational causes. David resides in Monaco and Florida; Simon in Monaco.
