Their much-anticipated redevelopment project, Capitol Singapore, came to a halt last year when its partner Perennial Real Estate, backed by billionaire Kuok Khoon Hong, went to court to propose a liquidation of the project, citing a deadlock among shareholders.The Kwees are redeveloping 2 of Sydney's historic sandstone buildings into a 240- room luxury hotel. In New York they are building an 82-story tower beside the Museum of Modern Art that has apartments ranging in price from $3 million to more than $70 million. The company was founded by their Indonesian father Henry Kwee, a textile trader and real estate developer who migrated to Singapore in 1958.
