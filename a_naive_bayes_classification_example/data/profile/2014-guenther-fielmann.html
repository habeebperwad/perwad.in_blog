			Born in 1939 in the tiny northern German village of Stafstedt (population at the time: 300), Guenther Fielmann is the founder and CEO of eyeglasses giant Fielmann AG. He opened his first optometry shop in Cuxhaven, Germany, in 1972, and took the company public in 1994. Today, the Fielmann family controls 71.64% of its shares.  This is split between KORVA SE, a subsidiary of the family's foundation, and Guenther Fielmann, his son Marc and his daughter Sophie-Luise. All three directly hold shares of Fielmann AG. In December 2015, Marc was given a seat on the company's management board, with responsibility for marketing the Fielmann brand -- a sign that the reins could be handed over to him fairly soon. Marc Fielmann attended the exclusive Schule Schloss Salem boarding school in Germany and also studied at the London School of Economics. Fielmann AG sells nearly half the prescription eyeglasses in Germany, and also has outlets in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. A committed environmentalist, Guenther Fielmann plants a new tree for every employee each year, and owns two organic farms as well as an ecologically friendly estate in Schleswig-Holstein.
