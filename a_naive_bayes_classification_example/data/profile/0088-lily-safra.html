			Brazil-born, Monaco-based billionaire Lily Safra inherited most of her fortune from her fourth husband, the late Edmond J. Safra, a multibillionaire banker. Edmond's 1999 death in a fire at his Monaco penthouse made worldwide headlines and prompted conspiracy theories despite his nurse's admission of guilt.  Edmond left most of his fortune to the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, but he also left Lily enough assets to make her a billionaire. She chairs the philanthropic foundation, which supports education, science, medicine, religion, culture and humanitarian relief in 40 countries and has reportedly donated more than $250 million since its creation in 1977. Lily's second marriage, to Alfredo Monteverde, founder of Brazilian appliance giant Ponto Frio, ended with his suicide in 1969. He left her with a stake in Ponto Frio, which she sold in 2009 to Brazilian retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar for about $340 million. In 2012 she launched a lawsuit seeking additional payment from Ponto Frio, claiming to have suffered financial damages from the manner in which payments for the deal were set up. In August 2015 a Brazilian court ruled in her favor.
