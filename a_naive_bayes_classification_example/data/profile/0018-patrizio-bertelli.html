			The business genius behind fashion powerhouse Prada, Patrizio Bertelli was born in the Tuscan city of Arezzo to a family of prominent lawyers. He dropped out while studying for an engineering degree at the University of Bologna and got into the production of leather goods, eventually becoming a supplier to Miuccia Prada in 1977 after meeting her at a trade fair.  A year later they were married and Bertelli joined the company. Focusing on the business side, as the CEO Bertelli pushed Prada SpA, the family business founded by Miuccia's grandfather in 1913, to expand its product offerings beyond high end luggage, handbags and steamer trunks. By 1986 the company had opened its own store in New York, and in the 1990s it unveiled a ready-to-wear women's collection, along with a second brand, Miu Miu. After a buying spree during which Prada acquired Helmut Lang, Jil Sander, and a stake in Fendi, and also load up on debt, Bertelli orchestrated a new strategy, eventually taking the company public in Hong Kong in 2011. His wife Miuccia became co-CEO alongside him in 2014. An avid sailor, his Luna Rossa team competed in the America's Cup on four occasions, winning Bertelli a spot in the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 2012.
