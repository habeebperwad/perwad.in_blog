			Visual bookmarking site Pinterest has grown in popularity partly thanks to its chief creative officer and cofounder Evan Sharp. Sharp met Silbermann through a mutual friend when he was a student in Columbia University's architecture program and was soon invited to join Cold Brew Labs, a startup Silbermann and third Pinterest cofounder Paul Sciarra had started together.  Soon after, Silbermann, Sharp and Sciarra launched the first desktop version of Pinterest in March 2010. It's now valued at $11 billion. As chief creative officer Sharp uses his architecture background to lead the front-end engineering and design divisions of Pinterest.
