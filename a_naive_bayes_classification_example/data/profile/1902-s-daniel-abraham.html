			SlimFast founder S. Daniel Abraham has not slowed down since selling his company to Unilever for $2.3 billion in 2000. The nonagenarian remains politically active, and regularly uses his wealth to advance his personal agenda.  He started his own nonprofit, the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace, in 1989, spoke out against the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, and more recently donated heavily to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. After serving in World War II, Abraham launched Thompson Medical Supply in 1947 before founding Slim Fast in 1976. Sales exploded in the late 1980's when former LA Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda became the product's public spokesman. After cashing out at the turn of the millennium, Abraham has often taken a risk-averse investing approach, keeping the majority of his fortune in cash and liquid assets.
