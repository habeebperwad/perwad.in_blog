			Alvaro Saieh Bendeck owns about 30% of Itau CorpBanca, a bank born out of the 2016 merger between Brazilian financial titan Itau and Chilean firm CorpBanca. Saieh Bendeck built Corpbanca after buying Chile's Banco Concepcion in 1995. Corpbanca, in which Saieh Bendeck held a majority stake before the fusion, acquired Banco Santander's Colombian unit in 2012. In 2016, Saieh sold his stake in insurance companies CorpSeguros and CorpVida.  He also serves as the president of SMU, a Chilean supermarket chain in which he is a major stakeholder. In 2013, Saieh invested $300 million in the company, which has been struggling in recent years due to integration problems following more than 70 acquisitions; SMU went public in January 2017. He also owns the Grand Hyatt hotel in Santiago, Chile.
