			EBay's Pierre Omidyar is no longer chairman of the company he founded, but he still sits on the board and is also a director of its former payment subsidiary, PayPal.  Omidyar has slowly been whittling down his stake in both eBay and PayPal by giving shares away to his philanthropic investment firm, the Omidyar Network; he still owns about 7% of eBay.  In March 2016, he quietly launched a venture capital firm, Omidyar Technology Ventures, which he is solely funding. Born in France to Iranian parents, Omidyar moved to the U.S. with his family at age 6. He wrote code for his website, Auction Web, at age 28 and renamed it eBay after his first choice, Echo Bay, was already taken. A resident of Hawaii, Omidyar owns resort properties in southern California and Mexico and is currently developing real estate in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. He's also the founder of First Look Media, the parent company of online news site The Intercept. In February 2017, he announced he'd be providing 26,000 Kenyans with a fixed daily income for 12 years.
