			Daniel Loeb, the founder of activist hedge fund Third Point, has navigated financial markets more deftly than many of his battered activist peers over the last few years. His main hedge fund returned 6.1% in 2016. Loeb, who manages $15 billion at Third Point, told his investors he expects the markets to be more friendly for activist investors with Donald Trump in the White House.  At the same time, Loeb is starting to tinker with using quantitative approaches to investing. Loeb has launched an initiative with fellow hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer and the Human Rights Campaign, America's largest LGBT civil rights organization, designed to protect LGBT rights globally in the face of increasing discrimination. He serves as the chairman of the board of Success Academies Charter Schools in Brooklyn and also is a trustee of the US Olympic Committee. A lifelong surfer who grew up in Los Angeles, Loeb is now firmly entrenched in New York.
