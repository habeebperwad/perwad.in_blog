			Leonardo Del Vecchio's eyewear giant Luxottica announced plans to merge with French lens manufacturer Essilor in January 2017, putting Luxottica's octogenarian founder at the helm of what will be the world's largest producer and retailer of sunglasses and prescription glasses.  The combination, to be known as EssilorLuxottica, is set to control 27% of the global eyewear market; Johnson & Johnson, the next largest firm, has a 3.9% share. Del Vecchio founded Luxottica in 1961 when he was 25; it later acquired popular brands Ray-Ban and Oakley and retailers Sunglass Hut and LensCrafters. The company produces glasses for a host of brands, including Bulgari, Chanel, Armani and Ralph Lauren. Del Vecchio also holds stakes in Italian insurance giant Assicurazioni Generali, French real estate company Foncière des Régions and Italian bank UniCredit. At age 7, Del Vecchio was sent to an orphanage because his widowed mother could not afford to support her five children. He apprenticed at a factory to put himself through design school at age 14 before striking out on his own a decade later. "Work always came before everything," he once told FORBES. "If I'd started selling fruit, I'd be passionate about fruit." His son Claudio owns U.S. men's retailer Brooks Brothers.
