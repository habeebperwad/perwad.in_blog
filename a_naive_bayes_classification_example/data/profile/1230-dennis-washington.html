			Dennis Washington parlayed an early love of machinery into a diversified group that now includes Montana Rail Link, which transports freight, a copper mine in Butte, and a Vancouver barge business. He also has an investment in Seaspan, cofounded by his son Kyle, which has 117 containerships and an $8 billion contract with the Canadian Navy and Coast Guard.  It's been quite a journey for Washington, who got polio at age 8 and spent 8 months in a hospital. He lived in government housing and shined shoes for pocket money. At 17, he went to Alaska, where he became a heavy crane operator for a time.   Washington, who splits his time between 4 homes and 2 yachts, says there is no secret to his success: "People downplay the role of timing. I relied on my instincts, and things kind of fell into place."
