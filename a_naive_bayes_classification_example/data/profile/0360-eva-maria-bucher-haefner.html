			Eva Maria Bucher-Haefner inherited half her father Walter's stake in IT management provider CA Technologies, formerly Computer Associates, after his death at age 101 in June 2012. To that point he had been the world's oldest billionaire.  She also inherited part of car dealer AMAG, which seeks brands including Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley and Porsche, and made $4.4 billion in revenue in 2016. In addition, Bucher-Haefner runs Moyglare, a 500-acre horse farm in Ireland that was also once her father's. Her brother, Martin Haefner, is a billionaire, too.
