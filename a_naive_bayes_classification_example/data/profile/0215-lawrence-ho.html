			A son of Macau gambling-industry legend Stanley Ho, Lawrence Ho gets the bulk of his fortune from his stake in Hong Kong-listed holding company Melco International, the leisure and entertainment outfit he runs.  Its Melco Crown Entertainment has one of six concessions and subconcessions to own and operate gambling outfits in Macau. Ho's gaming interests stretch well beyond Macau--Melco Crown owns and operates the $1.6 billion City of Dreams in Manila. Ho grew up mainly in Toronto and worked as an investment banker until Stanley, now 95 years old and largely retired since a 2009 fall at home, lured him into gaming.
