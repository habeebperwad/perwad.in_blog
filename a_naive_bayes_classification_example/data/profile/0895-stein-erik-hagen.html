			In 2014, Stein Erik Hagen appointed his daughter Caroline Marie Hagen Kjos to take over the reins of his family's investment company Canica AS, transferring most of his shares to her. However, while Caroline, now chairman, may have gotten most of the beneficial share, Stein Erik has kept a seat on the board and the shares with most of the votes (70%). Hagen founded discount supermarket Rimi with his father in the 1970s.  The chain merged with Dutch retailer Ahold in 2007 and Hagen eventually sold his stake. Hagen now has various investments across Scandinavia. He is chairman of consumer goods manufacturer Orkla ASA and owns hardware store chain Jernia. In early 2014 he donated $16 million to found the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Institute to research the disease. He has been diagnosed with the disease and has sought treatment in the U.S.
