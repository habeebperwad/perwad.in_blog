			The approximately $60 billion merger between the computer storage giant EMC and Dell, announced in October 2015, finally closed in September 2016. The deal was a result of Dell's long-awaited plan to accelerate his company's presence in the cloud computing business currently dominated by Amazon, Google and Microsoft.  Dell first went public in 1988 with a market capitalization of $85 million. He took it private again in 2013 for $25 billion, but a Delaware court ruled in a suit led by activist investor and fellow billionaire Carl Icahn in May 2016 that the company's value was actually worth $31 billion at the time it went private. Dell holds a 70% stake in the company, but most of his fortune lies in his private investment firm MSD Capital, whose wide array of investments includes ownership of the Four Seasons Hualalai in Hawaii and a reported $63 million stake in Grand Central Terminal in New York City.
