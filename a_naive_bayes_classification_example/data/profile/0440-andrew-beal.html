			Andrew "Andy" Beal, a college dropout, made a tidy sum during the Great Recession, buying distressed assets while the nation's biggest banks were getting taxpayer bailouts. He placed a big bet on U.S. oil and gas in 2015, offering secured loans to energy producers, but with cratering oil prices, he hasn't yet struck gold.  In 2001 he gambled against the world's top poker players at the Bellagio in Las Vegas in one of the highest-stakes poker games ever. The mathematics enthusiast developed the Beal Conjecture, a complex mathematical problem, in 1993, and offered $1 million to anyone who could solve it. No one has.
