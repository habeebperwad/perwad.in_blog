			Catherine Lozick inherited an estimated 65% stake in Swagelok, the $2 billion (sales) valve-making business her father, Fred Lennon, cofounded with a $500 loan in 1947. Lennon, who first appeared on the Forbes 400 in 1990, died in 1998 and kept his succession plans a secret.  But the entrepreneur confounded his own plans when he reportedly gave John Lennon, his son, only $25 million and each of his grandchildren $50,000, while passing on the bulk of the estate to Lozick. That drew a 2002 lawsuit by John's son, William, against Lozick and her trustees that exposed the inner workings of the family's financials. Lozick settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay each grandchild an additional $1.25 million. She keeps a low profile, true to her father's motto: "Secrecy is success, success is secrecy."
