			Alejandro Santo Domingo serves as the public face of the Santo Domingo family, which holds a massive stake in beer giant Anheuser-Busch. In 2005 his father, Julio Mario Santo, Domingo traded his brewery, Bavaria, for a 15% stake in SABMiller, which in turn merged with Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016. When Julio Mario died in 2011, he passed down his shares to his sons, Alejandro and Andres, along with his grandchildren, Julio Mario III and Tatiana Casiraghi.  All four are now billionaires. A Harvard graduate, Alejandro is the managing director of New York-based Quadrant Capital Advisors and also sits on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, alongside fellow billionaires Leon Black, John Paulson and David Koch. He got married in 2016, reportedly to a direct descendant of the British general who vanquished Napoleon at Waterloo.
