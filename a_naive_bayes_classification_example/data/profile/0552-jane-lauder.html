			Jane Lauder, the granddaughter of cosmetics legend Estée Lauder, now runs the makeup company's Clinique unit, a mall-staple skin-care line and one of the 30 brands under the Estée Lauder umbrella. She's been at grandma's company since 1996, a year after graduating from Stanford.  Before Clinique, she managed Origins, maker of all-natural makeup. She replaced her father, Ronald, on the Estée Lauder board in 2009 and now serves alongside big sister Aerin and cousin William. Her husband, Kevin Warsh, also a Stanford grad, was the youngest-ever appointee to the Federal Reserve Board; he is currently a visiting fellow at their alma mater's Hoover Institution. The couple lives in Manhattan's trendy neighborhood Nolita.
