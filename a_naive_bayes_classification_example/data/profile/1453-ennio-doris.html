			Born into poverty, Ennio Doris is one of the leaders of Italy's financial sector. He founded Banca Mediolanum with an investment from fellow billionaire media tycoon and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in 1982. Doris was born in northeastern Italy.  With financial support from his sister, a seamstress, he completed his studies and began selling insurance policies. Hearing Silvio Berlusconi publicly say, "if anyone has an idea and needs an investor, come find me; if it's a good idea, we'll make it happen together," Doris decided to seek him out and pitched Berlusconi his idea: a financial services company that offered a wide variety of products. In 1982, they founded Programma Italia, which promoted the use of financing and credit. Restructured in 1996 into Mediolanum, which they took public that year, the firm, with Doris as CEO, offers life insurance, fund management, real estate loans and other products. In December 2015, Mediolanum merged with its fully-owned banking unit Banca Mediolanum in order to streamline its business; it now trades as the latter. Doris reimbursed his clients for their losses in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, a move that cost Mediolanum approximately $220 million and a dividend cut. He is still among Berlusconi's largest business partners. For a long time the charismatic Doris was the public face of the company's advertising campaigns, a role that has been delegated to his son, Massimo, who is chief executive of Banca Mediolanum.
