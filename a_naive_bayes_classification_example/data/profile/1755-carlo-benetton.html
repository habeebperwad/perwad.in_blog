			Along with his siblings Luciano, Giuliana, and Gilberto, Carlo Benetton helped found the Benetton Group clothing retailer in 1965. Their father died when eldest sibling Luciano was just 14 years old. To help his widowed mother, Luciano began working in a clothing store in Treviso, Italy.  A bright yellow sweater knitted by Giuliana caught the attention of Luciano's colleagues and led the siblings to found the Benetton Group. Benetton expanded internationally, opening its first store outside Italy in Paris in 1969 and New York in 1980. The Benetton Group hit some turbulence in the late 1990s due to an overvalued Italian lira and falling demand for their colorful sweaters. The siblings convinced Luciano to step back and give professional managers a greater role. In 2012, the family took the company private; Luciano's son Alessandro took over as chairman until 2014. Through their holding company Edizione, the siblings have invested in Italian businesses with interests in the food & beverage, real estate and publishing sectors, and through Atlantia S.p.A., their most valuable asset: highway concessions.
