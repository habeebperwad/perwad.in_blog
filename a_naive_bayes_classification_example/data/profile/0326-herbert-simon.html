			Herb and his brother Melvin (d. 2009) were raised in a Bronx walk-up, the sons of a Jewish tailor who immigrated from Central Europe. In 1960 the duo founded the precursor to Simon Property Group. It is now one of the world's largest REITs, with 179 shopping malls covering 153 million square feet across America, Europe and Asia.  Melvin's son, David, has been CEO since 1995. Herb also owns the Indiana Pacers, which he bought with his brother; the team's value has doubled in the past year. He sits on the board of the Cheesecake Factory. He is a father of eight and on his third marriage--this time to a former Miss Universe from Thailand. In 2015, Herb asked a court to declare that Melvin's estate and widow have no stake in the Pacers, after she sued the IRS to recover more than $21 million in federal taxes.
