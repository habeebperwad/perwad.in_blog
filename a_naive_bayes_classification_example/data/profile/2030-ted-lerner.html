			In 1952 26-year-old Ted Lerner borrowed $250 from his wife to start a real estate company, selling homes for developers. After selling some 22,000, he decided to become a builder himself. Now he owns 20 million square feet of commercial and retail space, plus hotels, 7,000 apartments and the Washington Nationals.  The Lerners are on the short list of developers vying to build a new headquarters for the FBI, which is currently on hold until Congress gets funding. They donate to charities including Children's National Hospital in DC, George Washington University and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
