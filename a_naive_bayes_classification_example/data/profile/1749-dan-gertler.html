			Israeli-born Dan Gertler built a fortune through mining ventures in Africa's developing economies -- primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In February 2017, he sold his stakes in Congo's Mutanda and Katanga mines to commodities giant Glencore in a $960 million deal; Gertler's take is an estimated $534 million before taxes.  His time in Congo has been dogged by accusations from NGOs that he snapped up mining assets on the cheap by cozying up to politicians. He vigorously denies the claims and has taken steps to show he's a good faith actor. In 2013, his Gibraltar-based firm Fleurette joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and reconfirmed its commitment in early 2016. Gertler's grandfather was the first president of the Israeli Diamond Exchange; Gertler sold off those diamond assets to fund purchases in copper, gold and oil mining. He bought his first mine in the DRC in 1997 and soon became friends with DRC President Joseph Kabila. Gertler plans to drill for oil in the DRC's Lake Albert, where early seismic tests have revealed as many as 3 billion barrels of oil. He has also developed a 1,482-acre kibbutz-style farm in the DRC, designed as a model to help address food insecurity. His charitable foundation, also operating in the DRC, supports teenage women who become mothers after being raped, among other initiatives.
