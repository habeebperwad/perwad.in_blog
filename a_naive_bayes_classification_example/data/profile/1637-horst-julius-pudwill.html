			Horst Julius Pudwill cofounded Techtronic Industries, a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of power tools and floor-care products. Its Hoover vacuum-cleaner brand is so iconic that many people use it as verb, such as to hoover the carpet.  He came to Hong Kong from Germany in the mid-1970s to promote Volkswagens. He started a trading company in 1978 and three of the original six people remain there today--including Roy Chi Ping Chung, who retired as executive vice chairman in 2011 but remains on the board. His first two decades in business were similar to the careers of many other entrepreneurs in Greater China--lining up suppliers for Western brands and eventually manufacturing for them under contract. Techtronic Industries started as a supplier to the hand tool industry and today it is one of the world's largest manufacturers of power tools and power equipment. Pudwill chairs Techtronic and is no longer involved in the company's day-to-day operation, leaving it to the CEO he hired in 2008, Joseph Galli, and his designated successor Stephan, his only child.
