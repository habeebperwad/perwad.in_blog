			Mehmet Sinan Tara is CEO of Turkey's largest construction company, ENKA Construction. Traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, it also operates in the fields of engineering, energy, real estate and trade. Over half of its approximately $4.6 billion in revenue come from energy production.  With three natural gas conversion plants that produce approximately 30 billion kilowatt-hours annually, it is Turkey's leading private electricity producer. ENKA Construction has contracts for big infrastructure projects and builds U.S. embassy buildings in various countries, as well as office buildings and shopping malls. ENKA's extensive investments in Moscow commercial real estate have been negatively affected by a lax Russian economy. His father, ENKA founder Sarik Tara, also is a billionaire.
