			James Dyson, the art school graduate who became the U.K.'s most famous modern inventor, relies on constant failure to create the retail successes that have made him rich. His first breakthrough product, the bagless vacuum cleaner, took 5 years and 5,127 prototypes.  There's since been an $1,000 robotic vacuum cleaner (17 years, 1,000-plus prototypes) and, most recently, the $400 Supersonic hair dryer (4 years, 600 prototypes), which launched in September 2016. They add up: Dyson's 58 products generated $2.4 billion in sales in 2015 and an estimated $340 million in net profits, even after Dyson reinvested 46% of the company's Ebitda in R&D. Dyson is planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to develop at least 100 new products by 2020, nearly double what it now has on the market and equivalent to the number of products introduced since its founding.
