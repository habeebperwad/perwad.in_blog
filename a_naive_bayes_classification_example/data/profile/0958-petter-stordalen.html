			Petter Stordalen owns Scandinavia's largest hotel chain, Nordic Choice Hotels, which has 180 high-end hotels in five countries. In January 2017, Stordalen bought the Hilton at Copenhagen airport, and plans to spend $100 million renovating the hotel and adding 500 rooms.  He got his start working at his father's grocery store in the town of Porsgrunn at age 10. He later helped found Steen & Strom Invest, one of Norway's largest commercial real estate firms. A committed environmentalist, Stordalen chained himself to the U.K.'s Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in protest in 2002. He married model-turned-physician Gunhild Stordalen in a lavish $5 million affair officiated by Bob Geldof in 2010. In late 2014 he disclosed that his wife had been diagnosed with systemic scleroderma, a rare autoimmune disease. While still in treatment, Gunhild has remained active as chairman of the couple's Stordalen Institute, which promotes social and environmental responsibility. A former Ironman triathlete, Stordalen runs 6 miles a day.
