			Tennessee governor Bill Haslam was briefly the richest politician in America -- until Donald Trump decided to run for president. Haslam held off endorsing his fellow Republican billionaire. Before being elected, Haslam was president of his family's chain of truck stops, Pilot Flying J.  On a bike ride with pal Bob Corker (then Chattanooga mayor, now U.S. senator) Haslam first got the idea to run for office. He was elected Knoxville mayor in 2003, then earned a key to the governor's mansion in 2010 and won reelection in a landslide. His brother Jimmy runs Pilot Flying J.
