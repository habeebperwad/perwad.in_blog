			Najib Mikati resigned in March 2013 after two years as Lebanon's prime minister. A political moderate, he struggled to keep a country deeply divided along sectarian lines out of the Syrian conflict. Before his foray into politics, he and his brother Taha were telecom operators in Africa and Syria through their company Investcom.  They sold it to MTN Group of South Africa in 2006 for $3.6 billion in cash and stock, and formed M1 Group, an entity with investments in telecom, real estate and retail.
