			Charles Simonyi is the only tourist to have visited space twice. He paid $60 million to jet to the International Space Station on a Russian rocket in 2007 and 2009, after six months of training. Born in Hungary, Simonyi immigrated to the U. S. when he was 18. He studied engineering and math at UC Berkeley, then got a Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford. After a decade working for Xerox PARC, he joined Microsoft in 1981 as employee No. 40. He went on to develop Microsoft Word and Excel. In 2002, he left to pursue his childhood dream of space travel and to found his own software firm, Intentional Software. Simonyi's terrestrial passions include collecting works by modern artist Roy Lichtenstein. Between 2003 and 2013, Simonyi and his wife gave out $100 million in grants to art, science and education groups, primarily in Seattle, through their foundation.
