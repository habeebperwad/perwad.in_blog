			The roots of Miguel Fluxa Rossello's Iberostar Group go back to the 19th century when the Fluxa family started a footwear business in Majorca, Spain. In 1956 Grupo Iberostar entered the tourism industry.  In 1986, Miguel joined the family company, which was still small, and founded the first Iberostar hotels in Majorca and the Canary Islands. International expansion followed in 1993 with the group's first hotel opening in the Caribbean. In 2006 Rossello sold the group's tour operators and travel agencies divisions to the Carlyle Group for $950 million. With a focus on hotels, Grupo Iberostar now generates more than $1.5 billion in revenues; it has hotels in 27 countries and 22,000 employees. Fluxa Rossello serves as the group's executive chairman.
