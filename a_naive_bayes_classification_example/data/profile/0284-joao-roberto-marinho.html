			Joao Roberto Marinho and his two billionaire brothers, Jose Roberto and Roberto Irineu Marinho, inherited control of Globo, Latin America's largest media group. The conglomerate began in Rio de Janeiro in 1925 when their grandfather, Irineu Marinho, launched a newspaper.  Irineu died only 25 days after the first issue of the newspaper was published, leaving the company to his oldest son, the late Roberto Marinho, who built it into the media conglomerate it is today. Globo was rebranded in 2014 as "Grupo Globo," which includes Brazil's largest broadcaster, Rede Globo; Infoglobo, Brazil's largest newspaper company; and Globosat, the largest pay TV provider in Latin America. Joao Roberto began his career as a journalist with O Globo, Infoglobo's main title and one of Brazil's most influential newspapers. He held a number of positions before becoming editor-in-chief. He is now deputy chair of the Grupo Globo's board of directors and chair of the Editorial Board and Institutional Committee.
