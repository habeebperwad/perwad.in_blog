			Born in Taiwan, Jen-Hsun Huang moved to Thailand with his family as a child. As civil unrest mounted, his parents sent him and his brother to live with their aunt and uncle, who were new immigrants to the U. S. They in turn sent the brothers to a boarding school in rural Kentucky for troubled youth, mistaking it for a prep school. There, Huang was assigned to clean the boys' bathroom everyday after school, while his brother worked on the tobacco farm. They eventually reunited with their parents in Oregon, and Huang obtained an engineering degree from Stanford. He cofounded graphics-chip maker Nvidia in 1993. The company has since become a dominant force in computer gaming and has expanded to design chips for data centers and autonomous cars.
