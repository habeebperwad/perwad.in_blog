			Peter Sperling is the son of John Sperling, the for-profit education pioneer who founded the University of Phoenix and its parent company, Apollo Education Group. Peter joined the business in 1983, a decade after his father founded it, and became Apollo's chairman in 2012. In February 2017, Apollo was acquired by a consortium of investors that includes private equity firms Vistria Group and Apollo Global Management.  The company, which had gone public in 1994, was taken private in the $1.1 billion deal, and Sperling was replaced as chairman. He had been a big investor in the company until shares started declining in 2009 as enrollment dropped in the system, which offers classes online and at a patchwork of campuses in dozens of states. He then began unloading most of his stake despite continuing to work in the management of the business.
