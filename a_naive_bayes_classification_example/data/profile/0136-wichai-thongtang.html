			Lawyer-turned-investor Wichai Thongtang, who represented former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, gets the biggest chunk of his fortune from a minority stake in hospital operator Bangkok Dusit. Wichai's portfolio includes TWZ, a distributor of mobile phones and peripheral devices.  Last September, he shut down pay-TV operator CTH which had been suffering losses after acquiring expensive broadcast rights for English Premier League football. Wichai has set up Link Network to create a countrywide network of retailers.
