			Giuliana Benetton and her three brothers, Luciano, Gilberto, and Carlo, founded the clothing retailer Benetton Group in 1965. After the death of their father when the eldest Luciano was just 14 years old, Luciano started working at a clothing store in Treviso, Italy.  A bright yellow jumper sweater knitted by Giuliana caught the attention of Luciano's colleagues and led to the siblings to found the Benetton Group. They expanded internationally, opening the first store outside of Italy in Paris in 1969 and New York in 1980. The company ran controversial, award-winning shock advertising campaigns in 1982, including a focus on the AIDS epidemic. Benetton hit turbulence at the turn of the century due to an overvalued Italian lira and falling demand for their colorful sweaters. The siblings convinced Luciano to take a step back and give professional managers a greater role. In 2012, Benetton Group was taken private and Luciano's son Alessandro took over as chairman until 2014. Through holding company Edizione, the family has invested in Italian businesses, including food & beverage, publishing, banking and their most valuable holding, highway concessions, through Atlantia S.p.A
