			Nathan Kirsh made his first fortune in his native Swaziland, founding a corn milling business in the country in 1958. He expanded into wholesale food distribution in apartheid South Africa, and then into supermarkets and commercial property development.  South African insurance company Sanlam bought 49% of Kirsh's company, and he entered into agreements to build a slew of what turned out to be financially unviable shopping malls -- backed by company assets. Suddenly, Kirsh was broke. The bulk of his current fortune comes from Jetro Holdings, which operates Jetro Cash and Carry stores and Restaurant Depots in the New York City area -- supplying wholesale goods to bodegas, small stores and restaurants. Kirsh's charitable endeavors are focused on Swaziland, where he has supplied more than 12,000 people with starter capital for small businesses.
