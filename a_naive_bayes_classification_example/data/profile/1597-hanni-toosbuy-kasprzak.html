			Hanni Toosbuy Kasprzak is the owner and chairman of $1.3 billion (sales) Danish shoe manufacturer, ECCO. The company typically sells more than 20 million pairs of shoes annually, each one apparently touched by 210 pairs of hands before it reaches the consumer.  ECCO, which today has over 1,300 stores, was founded by Toosbuy Kasprzak's late father, Karl Toosbuy, in 1963. She joined the family business straight out of school and worked in different departments to learn the ropes; she was a quality controller in India for a time. After a stint in Germany, she returned to Denmark in 1997 and took over as chairman. Her husband, Dieter Kasprzak, a onetime designer, was the president of the company for over a decade; he handed over daily operations of the company to Steen Borgholm, former CFO, in 2016. Their son Andr√© is a professional golfer, and daughter Anna is a dressage rider.
