			Daniel Kretinsky joins the billionaire ranks after selling 31% of energy firm EPH for $1.6 billion to a consortium of investors led by Australia-based asset manager Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets in 2016.Two decades ago, Kretinsky started working as a lawyer for Slovak investment company J&T; now he runs and co-owns the biggest energy group in Central Europe.  EPH (Energetický a průmyslový Holding) owns more than 50 companies in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Italy, the U.K., Poland and Hungary, operating in electricity distribution and supply, gas storage and transmission, with some 25 000 employees. His strategy has been to find big players in the energy market that are struggling, buy their old coal-powered plants and mines, and bet on increasing electricity prices. Kretinsky owns 37% of EPH; he built up his equity stake over time by choosing to be compensated in shares instead of cash as the company has grown.
