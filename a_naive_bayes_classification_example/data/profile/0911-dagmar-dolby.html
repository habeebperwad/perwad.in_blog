			Dagmar Dolby, the widow of sound technology pioneer Ray Dolby (d. 2013), owns just under half of the company her husband founded in 1965. Her two sons share voting power over some of the holdings. Dolby Laboratories invented surround sound, and its technologies have been used in thousands of films and billions of products, earning Ray a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in 2015. More recently, it has developed sound technology for home entertainment, video games and mobile devices.  Dagmar Dolby graduated from Heidelberg University in her native Germany. She met Ray in 1962 while studying in a summer language program in the U.K. She pledged $53 million in December 2015 to expand the campus of the University of Cambridge, where Ray earned a PhD in physics. A month earlier, she committed $20 million to the University of California, San Francisco, for research on mood disorders. In 2014, the family founded Dolby Family Ventures, which invests in early-stage startups with potential to solve social problems. Dagmar's son David is managing director of the fund, as well as a board member at Dolby Labs. Her son Tom is a novelist and filmmaker.
