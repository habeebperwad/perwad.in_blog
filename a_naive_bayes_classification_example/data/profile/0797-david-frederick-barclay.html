			Two of Britain's richest and most private brothers, David and Frederick Barclay, are best known for their real estate and hotel portfolio, which includes London's Ritz and Monaco's Mirabeau among other properties.  The duo sold London hotel group Maybourne, owner of luxury landmarks Claridges, the Berkeley and the Connaught, to Qatari investors in 2015, ending a years long battle over the control of the company with other partners. The identical twins started together in GE's accounts department and then flipped houses before buying their first hotel in 1975. Their business interests now include the Telegraph Newspaper Group and UK e-retailer Shop Direct Group, which has over $2 billion in annual sales. David and Frederick live together in a mansion on the English Channel island of Brecqhou and have significant investments on neighboring Sark.
