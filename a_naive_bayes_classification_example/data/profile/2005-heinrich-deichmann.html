			Heinrich Deichmann leads his family's shoe retailer, Deichmann-Schuhe SE. He is named after his grandfather Heinrich, who began the firm as a cobbler's shop in 1913. The founder, who died in 1940 at age 52, criticized the Nazi regime for its persecution of his fellow Jewish citizens.  After the war, his son, Heinz-Horst, studied medicine and theology, while also helping out in the shop, which his mother, Julie, had managed to keep open during the war years. In 1945, according to the company's official history, the Deichmanns hired 12 employees and got to work making 50,000 pairs of shoes from poplar wood and parachute harnesses. They also organized an exchange for second-hand shoes. Heinrich took over in 1999 from his father, Heinz-Horst, who died in 2014. The Essen, Germany-based company, with annual revenue of over $5 billion, is now Europe's leading shoe retailer. It operates more than 3,700 stores in 24 countries, including the Rack Room Shoes and Off Broadway chains in the U.S. Following in the footsteps of his philanthropist father, Heinrich has continued the "Wort und Tat" program Heinz-Horst initially devised to help leprosy victims in India. The program now provides a wide range of medical treatments that have benefitted more than 200,000 people in places like Germany, Greece, Tanzania and Moldova, where Heinrich founded a program that provides hot meals and second-hand clothes to those in need.
