			Wang Jianlin is China's richest man. He is taking steps to build out his Dalian Wanda entertainment and real estate empire. In an October 2016 visit to Los Angeles, Wang announced that he would offer a 40% production rebate for movies and TV shows that shoot at his new megastudio in Qingdao.  This follows Wang's January 2016 purchase of L.A. production firm Legendary Entertainment and his 2012 acquisition of U.S. movie house chain AMC Theatres. In December 2016, Wang issued a warning to President-elect Trump that thousands of U.S. jobs -- at places like AMC Theatres -- would be at risk if Trump prevents further purchases of U.S. companies. Wang, who spent his youth in the military, made his initial fortune in real estate. His Dalian Wanda Commercial Property is the country's largest commercial real estate developer; it delisted from the Hong Kong exchange in September and may relist on a mainland exchange. In May he launched theme park Wanda City in Nanchang, and has plans for 15 theme parks in China and 5 overseas. In September, Wanda broke ground on a $900 million, 95-story structure in Chicago that will be the city's third-tallest building.
