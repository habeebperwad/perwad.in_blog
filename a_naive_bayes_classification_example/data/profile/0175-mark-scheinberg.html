			Mark Scheinberg made a fortune off of online poker. He and his father, Isai Scheinberg, built PokerStars into the world's biggest internet poker company. Founded in 2001, it first operated out of Costa Rica but eventually moved to the Isle of Man.  In 2014 PokerStars' parent, Rational Group (which also owned Full Tilt Poker), was sold for $4.9 billion to Amaya, a publicly-traded company based in Montreal. Scheinberg was the biggest single shareholder of Rational Group. Born in Israel, Scheinberg moved to a suburb of Toronto at age 13. He left college after one year, worked in the hospitality industry and traveled for long stretches to Asia and South America, before getting into the online gambling business at age 28. PokerStars became revered by players for hosting massive tournaments. The company benefited tremendously from the poker boom that swept the U.S. and the rest of world starting in 2003 after an unknown Tennessee accountant named Chris Moneymaker became a famous millionaire by winning the World Series of Poker's Main Event. Moneymaker got his seat at the World Series of Poker by winning an online PokerStars play-in.
