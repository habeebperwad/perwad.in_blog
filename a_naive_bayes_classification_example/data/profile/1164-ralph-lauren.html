			The founder of America's beloved fashion brand, Ralph Lauren stepped down as the company's CEO in 2015. He remains chairman of the $7.4 billion (sales) company and also controls 82% of the voting rights.  His son David, who is married to Lauren Bush (a niece of former President George W. Bush), became chief innovation officer and vice chairman of the board in October 2016; son Andrew is an indie film producer, while daughter Dylan founded and runs boutique candy shop chain Dylan's Candy Bar. Born Ralph Lifshitz in the Bronx to Russian Jewish immigrants, Lauren worked part time in the garment industry as a teenager. He then opened a tie-making business in a tiny office at the Empire State building. Lauren's car collection, valued at more than $300 million, may be one of the world's most valuable.
