			Indian-born diamond jewellery designer Nirav Modi is the founder of the $1.8 billion (revenues) Firestar Diamond, which makes diamond jewelry for exports. In recent years he has been expanding the retail presence of his Nirav Modi brand with eight stores in locations such as Delhi, New York, Mumbai, Hong Kong, London and Macau.  He recently appointed Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra as brand ambassador and says he plans to open 10 more stores. Modi grew up in Belgium, dropped out of Wharton and moved to India where he got trained in the diamond trade under his uncle. He went on to launch his own Nirav Modi brand, which has a roster of uber rich clients. In January, the federal income tax authorities launched a tax probe on Modi's business. The company said it has cooperated with the tax authorities and that it conducts its business in absolute compliance with the law.
