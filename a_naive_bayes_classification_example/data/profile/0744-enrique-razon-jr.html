In recent years it's suffered from a slowdown in global trading; income was down by almost 65% in 2015. ICTSI said it plans to revive a container rail service through the Philippines' capital in Manila.  Razon's grandfather began with a port in Manila in 1916. Razon's dad rebuilt the business after World War II. Razon started out in the port business with his dad in Manila and transformed it into a global giant. His hospitality firm, Bloomberry Resorts Co., includes its crown jewel, the Solaire Casino and Resort in the Philippines.
