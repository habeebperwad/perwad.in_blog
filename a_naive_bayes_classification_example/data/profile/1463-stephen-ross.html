			Stephen Ross, chairman of Related Companies, is the developer behind America's largest private real estate project. His $15 billion mega-development, Hudson Yards (a 28-acre neighborhood on Manhattan's West Side) opened its first building in May 2016. The development won't be done until 2024 at the earliest - meaning it will take at least 12 years since it first broke ground.  When its fully open, the company estimates it will add 2.5%, or $19 billion annually, to the city's gross domestic product. Down south, Ross owns the Miami Dolphins, and he's putting $400 million of his own money into renovating Dolphins Stadium. Ross also owns the Equinox fitness centers with two other partners, and the group is majority shareholders in SoulCycle, which filed initial papers for its IPO in July 2015.
