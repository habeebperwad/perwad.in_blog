			Farmer's son, Karsanbhai Patel, is India's detergent king. The low-profile entrepreneur started off mixing soda ash in his backyard and selling door-to-door on his bicycle. The launch of his low-price Nirma brand, named after his late daughter Nirupama, set off a detergents war with bigger rivals such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble.  In 2012, Patel, who has handed over operations to the next generation, took Nirma private. Led by son Hiren, Nirma is expanding its cement business. In July the company beat bidders such as Ajay Piramal and the Jindal family's JSW Cement to buy French cement major Lafarge's India operations for $1.4 billion.
