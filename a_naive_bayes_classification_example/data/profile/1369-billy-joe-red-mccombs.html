			Red McCombs got his start selling Ford Edsels, built up a network of Texas auto dealerships, then diversified. He liked radio stations (good for airing car commercials) enough to co-found what became Clear Channel Communications.  Always a sports fan, over the years he has bought and sold the Minnesota Vikings, the Denver Nuggets and the San Antonio Spurs. Today most of his net worth is in real estate and energy investments, though he still has a few dealerships and has been vocal in opposing efforts by Tesla Motors to sell directly to customers in Texas. The state's franchise dealer law, McCombs is reported as saying, is "as sacred as Paul's letter to the Corinthians." He's a big investor in Constellis, the security company formerly known as Blackwater.
