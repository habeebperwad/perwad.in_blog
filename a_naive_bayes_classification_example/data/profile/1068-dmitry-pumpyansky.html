			Dmitry Pumpyansky has moved well beyond making pipes, the source of his wealth. His Sinara Group created a joint venture with German industrial giant Siemens that won a $2.7 billion contract from Russian Railways in 2011 to deliver modern electric trains called Lastochka (swallow bird). It has delivered more than 50 of these trains, with plans to deliver another 190.  His companies are also giving a facelift to a stadium that will host the 2018 World Cup in Ekaterinburg.  Pumpyansky got his start as a trader, then oversaw several metals plants in the Urals during the 1990s before taking over the Sinarsky Pipe Factory. He eventually teamed with fellow billionaires Sergei Popov and Andrei Melnichenko to acquire pipe conglomerate TMK, and then bought them out in 2006. He was later forced to surrender his controlling stake to state-owned banks as security for a $1.85 billion loan. Two years later Pumpyansky was back in control of TMK.
