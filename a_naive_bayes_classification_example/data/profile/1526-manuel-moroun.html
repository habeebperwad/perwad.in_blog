			Trucking magnate "Matty" Moroun is more reclusive than ever, leaving his son Matthew as the public face in the family's ongoing legal battle with Canada and the state of Michigan over plans to replace their 88-year-old Ambassador Bridge with a new $700 million bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.  It's been a family money-maker for 35 years, but stands to lose up to 75 percent of its traffic when a competing bridge, funded by the Canadian government, is built. Meanwhile, the Morouns' trucking empire, a mix of private and publicly traded companies, is getting squeezed by competition.
