Barilla is the largest pasta company in the world with an estimated $3.7 billion in total sales.  Luca is the company's chairman. Founded in 1877 in Parma, Italy, Barilla had three generations of family leaders before selling to American company W.R. Grace in 1971. Eight years later, Pietro Barilla, Luca's father, bought Barilla back. Pietro's four children share ownership of the family company, which employs more than 8,000 people in Europe, Mexico and the U.S.
