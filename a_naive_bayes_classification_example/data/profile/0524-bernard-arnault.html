			One of the world's ultimate taste-makers, Bernard Arnault oversees an empire of 70 brands including Dom Perignon, Bulgari, Louis Vuitton, Sephora and Tag Heuer, as well as nearly 3,900 retail stores, all under the umbrella of luxury goods powerhouse LVMH.  The company, where he has been CEO since 1989, had record sales of nearly $40 billion in fiscal year 2016. The bulk of his fortune is tied up in Christian Dior stock, through which Arnault holds a controlling interest in LVMH. He also has billions of dollars of stock in LVMH directly, in supermarket chain Carrefour and in Hermes. An arts patron and collector, he is the visionary behind the $135 million Frank Gehry-designed Foundation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris' Bois de Boulogne, which opened in October 2014. LVMH is now working with the City of Paris to create another major new cultural institution that will be dedicated to artists and live performances.
