			Elisabeth (Liz) Mohn is the widow of Reinhard Mohn (d. 2009), who represented the fifth family generation in Bertelsmann. She and her three children own 19% of the German media conglomerate, whose holdings include 53% of the world's largest book-publishing group, Penguin Random House, and 75.1% of the leading European entertainment network, Luxembourg-based RTL Group.  Bertelsmann also owns 100% of Europe's biggest magazine publisher, Gruner + Jahr. Mohn exercises veto power over decisions made at the level of the holding company, in which 100% of Bertelsmann shares are parked. She serves on the supervisory board of the company and on the board of the Bertelsmann Foundation, which owns 81% of the company and focuses on education and fostering mutual understanding and dialogue between different nations and cultures. Liz and Reinhard Mohn had three children together, two of whom -- Brigitte and Christoph -- are on the company's supervisory board. Mohn can decide who is to succeed her upon her retirement. In 2003, Reinhard and Liz Mohn received the Teddy-Kollek Prize awarded by the Jerusalem Foundation for distinction in actively promoting German-Jewish understanding. (During the Nazi era, Bertelsmann published anti-semitic and pro-war propaganda books.) In the early 1990s, Liz founded the German Stroke Foundation and still serves as its president.
