			Edouard Carmignac wanted to be a rock star but settled for finance after receiving a BA in economics from the University of Paris and an MBA from Columbia University. In 1989 he founded Carmignac Gestion, now one of Europe's largest asset managers with more than $55 billion in assets under management.  He owns 70% of the company. Employees and executives own the rest. His daughter Maxime, who works at the company, is the heir apparent. His son is a guitarist and another daughter, Lucrece, is an actress.
