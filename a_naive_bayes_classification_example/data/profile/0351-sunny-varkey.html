			Son of Indian expat teachers who migrated to Dubai in 1959, Sunny Varkey controls GEMS Education, the world's largest operator of kindergarten-to-grade-12 schools with 89 worldwide. Varkey, who never went beyond high school himself, took over the management of his parents' Our Own English School in 1980, doing everything from laying bricks for school buildings to driving the school bus.  Today, the private education firm counts the Blackstone Group among its investors. In 2016, GEMS offered shares to its teachers in a bid to deter rivals from poaching them. It has also instituted three awards to recognise outstanding teachers, including one named after Varkey's mother. The education entrepreneur is well connected: former U.S. president Bill Clinton was honorary chairman of nonprofit arm Varkey Foundation until 2015.
