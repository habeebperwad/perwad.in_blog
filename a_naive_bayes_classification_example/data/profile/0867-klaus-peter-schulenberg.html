			Klaus-Peter Schulenberg founded his first company, a concert and event agency, in 1973, when he was still a college student. He bought CTS Eventim in 1996 and took it public in 2000. With the leading position in the European ticketing and live entertainment market, CTS Eventim has followed a path similar to Beverly Hills, Ca. -based Live Nation Entertainment, the product of a 2010 merger between Live Nation (a spin-off from Clear Channel Entertainment) and Ticketmaster. Pursuing an aggressive consolidation and diversification strategy, Schulenberg has bought up regional concert promoters, ticketing agencies, venue operators and event producers. According to the company, it sells more than 140 million tickets to more than 200,000 events annually. In late 2015, Schulenberg donated his 50.2% stake in CTS Eventim to the KPS Stiftung (KPS Foundation), converting from direct into indirect ownership to mitigate again potential risks posed by inheritance and tax issues. The company had revenue of around $860 million in 2015. Schulenberg is intensely private, so not much is known about him personally.
