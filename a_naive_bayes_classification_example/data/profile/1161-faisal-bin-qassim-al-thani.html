			At age 16, Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani started selling car parts in Doha, before establishing his eponymous holding company in 1964. Although he is a distant relative of Qatar's Emir, his spokesperson says he built his fortune from scratch into one of the largest conglomerates in Qatar.  Al Faisal Holding owns more than 20 hotels around the world, including the St. Regis in Washington, D.C. and Miami, and the W Hotel in London. It also has a majority stake in publicly-traded Aamal, which owns real estate in Qatar, and sells medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Al Thani has 10 children, four of whom are involved in running the business. A museum in Doha houses his collection of more than 15,000 artifacts, including antique cars, ancient coins and Islamic art.
