			Madeleine Olsson Eriksson is a part owner of Stena Sphere, a Swedish conglomerate with interests in shipping, offshore drilling, property and metal recycling, founded by her father in 1939. The company is helmed by her younger brother, Dan Sten Olsson (also a billionaire), who owns 51% of the company.  Seen as unfit to work in the shipping industry by her father due to her gender, she became the first of her family to go to college, earning a degree in medicine and pursuing a career as a gynecologist. Aside from an 18.5% stake in Stena, she is also part owner of a clinic in Gothenburg. She initially inherited 24.5%, but has since handed over 6% to her son Gustav, who after have tried his luck with a start-up selling hair products, has returned to the company and thereby becoming the heir apparent of the Stena Sphere.
