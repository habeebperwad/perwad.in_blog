			Over five decades Phil Anschutz has built fortunes in oil, railroads, telecom, real estate and entertainment. He started with his dad's small oil business, which nearly collapsed. He now owns the NHL's Kings and a third of the Lakers, plus the building they play in, the Staples Center.  His movie company produced the Chronicles of Narnia series. His AEG Live reps music artists and produces their concert tours. And on 300,000 acres he owns in Wyoming, Anschutz is fixing to build the world's biggest wind farm. In June 2016 he combined his two 5-star resorts, The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Sea Island in Georgia into a standalone company. To ensure these jewels stay in the family, he put them into a 100-year trust. A dedicated philanthropist, he endowed his family foundation with $1 billion, and donated his collection of some 400 masterpieces to create the American Museum of Western Art in Denver.
