			Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield Asset Management, is one of the biggest and best investors you've likely never heard of. A Winnipeg, Manitoba-native, Flatt began his investing career at Canadian conglomerate Brascan, once a major investor in Labatt's Beer and the Toronto Blue Jays until it nearly collapsed in the early 1990s.  He helped revive the company through a series of savvy real estate deals including the takeover of Olympia & York in 1996. Flatt became CEO in 2002 and refashioned Brascan into Brookfield Asset Management, now the world's biggest real estate manager and a leading investor in infrastructure, renewable energy and private equity with over $240 billion in assets. A patient contrarian by nature, Flatt's winning deals include the recapitalization of mall operator General Growth Properties in 2010 and the acquisition of London's 96-acre Canary Wharf development in 2015. Brookfield Asset Management's stock has risen a compounded annual 19% over the past 15 years.
