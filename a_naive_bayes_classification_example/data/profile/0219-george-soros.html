			Born in Hungary, George Soros fled the country and put himself through the London School of Economics working as a railway porter and a waiter before getting his start in finance at a merchant bank. He later moved to New York, got his start on Wall Street, and established his own hedge fund in 1969 with $12 million; it was later rebranded the Quantum Fund.  In 1992, with Stan Druckenmiller by his side, he shorted the British pound and made such an impressive profit that he became known as the man who broke the Bank of England. Decades later, Soros remains an investing heavyweight through Soros Fund Management, his family office which boasts $30 billion in assets. In 2017, Soros hired Dawn Fitzpatrick, one of Wall Street's most prominent women, to run his investment portfolio as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management. Fitzpatrick is the seventh CIO at Soros Fund Management since 2000. A longtime supporter of liberal causes, Soros has been a fierce critic of President Donald Trump.
