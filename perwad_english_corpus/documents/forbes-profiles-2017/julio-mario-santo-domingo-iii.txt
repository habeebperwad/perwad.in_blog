			Julio Mario Santo Domingo III is a disc jockey in New York City and an heir to one of the world's largest beer fortunes. His Colombian grandfather, who died in 2011, had owned the brewery Bavaria but traded it for 15% of beer giant SABMiller.  Julio Mario inherited a chunk of those SABMiller shares, along with his sister Tatiana Casiraghi and his uncles Alejandro and Andres. All four are now billionaires. SABMiller merged with Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016, but the family retained a stake. It also owns interests in a Latin American bank, TV station, hotel chain, film production studio and logistics hub. When Julio Mario III's father died, he left the world's largest collection of opium pipes, along with 50,000 books, posters, photographs and other memorabilia documenting psychoactive drugs and their effects on people and society. The collection is currently on long-term loan to Harvard University.
