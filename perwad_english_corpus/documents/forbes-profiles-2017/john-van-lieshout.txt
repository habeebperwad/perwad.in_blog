			Brisbane-based John Van Lieshout made his fortune from the Super Amart furniture chain. He sold the retailer in 2006 but retained the freehold to some stores. His wealth is now underpinned by a large property portfolio that includes shopping malls and offices, as well as housing developments from his new company, Unison Projects.
