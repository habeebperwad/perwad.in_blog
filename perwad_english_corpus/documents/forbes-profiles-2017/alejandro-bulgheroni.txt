			Alejandro Bulgheroni and his late brother Carlos (who died in September 2016 at age 71) inherited Argentine energy firm Bridas Corp. from their father decades ago; he started Bridas in 1948 to provide parts for the national oil company's pipeline network.  After their father died in 1985, Alejandro, the elder son and an industrial engineer, and Carlos, a lawyer, took over and moved Bridas into oil and gas exploration and production. In 2011, the Bulgheroni brothers sold a 50% stake in Bridas to China's state overseas oil company, CNOOC, for $3.1 billion. Alejandro serves as president and chairman of Bridas Corp. The company owns a 40% stake in oil producer Pan American Energy, which has operations in several Latin American countries. Alejandro is involved in the sustainable production of wine in Uruguay, Argentina, Australia, California and Tuscany. In 2014 he began a wine growing project in Patagonia set to become the southernmost vineyard in the world. Once completed, it will be the first to create a true ice wine in Patagonia.
