			Kjell Inge Rokke owns nearly 67% of publicly traded Aker, a shipping and offshore drilling conglomerate. Rokke got his start selling fish off a boat in Seattle before returning to his native Norway where he built a fleet and earned a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider.  In 2016 his Aker lessened the exposure to the industry that made Rokke rich by selling its stake in fishing company Havsfisk. Yacht-watchers say Rokke sold his super yacht Aglaia, which features a 3,600 square meter painting by Norwegian artist Magne Furuholmen on each side of the sail, at the end of 2014. He's rumored to have commissioned an even bigger yacht.
