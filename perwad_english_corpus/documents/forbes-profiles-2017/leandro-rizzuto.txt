			Leandro Rizzuto's Sicilian father, the youngest of 11 boys, came through Ellis Island to settle in New York City in 1905; his mom emigrated from Sicily the year before. His dad invented the pin-curl clip and the bristle-brush roller, and sold his inventions to local beauty parlors like the one he ran with his wife.  In 1959 Rizzuto left St. John's University to help his family set up a company to sell the hair products, which soon included their game-changing pistol-shaped hair dryer. Later called Conair, the company moved into small appliances; it acquired Cuisinart in 1989. Today Conair's brands also include electric toothbrush maker Interplak and hair-product lines Sc√ºnci, BaByliss and Rusk. Rizzuto and his children own just under 100% of the company. He also owns the Cuisinart Golf Resort & Spa in Anguilla, which features a Greg Norman-designed 18-hole golf course.
