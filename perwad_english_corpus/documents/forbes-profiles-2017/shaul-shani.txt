			Israeli investor Shaul Shani made the bulk of his fortune in 2009 when Brazilian firm Global Village Telecom, which he cofounded, was bought by Vivendi for $4.5 billion; he earned $1.4 billion after taxes on the deal.  Mezzanine lending and investments in emerging economies have further fattened his fortune. Shani has been starting companies and making deals since the early 1980s. He founded computer design and parts manufacturer Oshap Technologies in 1982 and took it public on the Nasdaq in 1985, then sold it to Sungard Data Systems for $210 million in stock in 1999. He also helped found software firms Sapiens and Tecnomatix, both of which also listed on Nasdaq and were eventually sold. Shani returned to telecom in 2007, buying a 10% stake in Israeli communications equipment maker ECI Telecom along with partner Ashmore Investment. The company struggled, and in January 2014 Shani assumed $200 million in liabilities and acquired Ashmore's 90% stake. ECI has expanded its footprint to North America and announced a partnership with Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Software. Industry insiders say that under Shani's ownership ECI, which lost money in 2013, is turning a profit.
