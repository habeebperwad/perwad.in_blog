			R. Budi Hartono and his brother, Michael (whose fortune is listed separately), are the richest people in Indonesia thanks to a fortune that goes back to their father, Oei Wie Gwan, who in 1950 acquired a bankrupt Indonesian cigarette company, later renaming it Djarum.  Today it is one of the biggest cigarette-makers in the nation, specializing in kreteks, a blend of cloves, tobacco and other ingredients. Budi's son, Victor, serves as Djarum's chief operating officer. Budi also has a big stake in publicly-traded Bank Central Asia.
