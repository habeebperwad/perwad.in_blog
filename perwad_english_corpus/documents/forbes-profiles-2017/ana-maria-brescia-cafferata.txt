			Ana María Brescia Cafferata inherited her fortune from her father, Fortunato Brescia Tassano, who built a real estate company that capitalized on Lima's growth. Fortunato died in 1951. Her assets were first managed by her brothers, Pedro and Mario, until they passed away.  Ana María, who never married and does not have children, owns 30% of Grupo Breca (short for Brescia Cafferata), a holding company with interests in agriculture, finance, hotels, manufacturing, mining and real estate. Grupo Breca owns Tasa, one of the largest producers of fish meal in the world.
