			When George Lindemann sold natural gas pipeline outfit Southern Union to pipeline giant Energy Transfer Equity for $5.7 billion in stock in 2012, it was the fifth industry in which the native New Yorker had found success.  Lindemann started working for his father's cosmetics company in 1957 after graduating from Wharton. In 1971, Lindemann sold his family's eye-care company, Permalens, and one year later founded Vision Cable. A decade later, the Newhouse brothers bought the cable TV company for $220 million. He started cellphone firm Metro Mobile, flipping it to Bell Atlantic for $2.5 billion in 1991, before getting into the energy business. An art collector, Lindemann has passed on his passion to his sons: George Jr. runs the Bass Museum in Miami, while Adam has a gallery in New York City.
