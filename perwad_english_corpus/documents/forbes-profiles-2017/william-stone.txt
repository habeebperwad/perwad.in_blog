			The Indiana native started financial-software firm SS&C Technologies in 1986 with the $20,000 he had saved from his days as a KPMG executive. Ten years later, he guided the company to an IPO, as its software started to gain steam among asset managers, bankers and insurers who wanted to electronically manage their books.  But the dot-com crash nearly crippled the company. "We had 610 people in June 1999. By December 2001, we had 250," said Stone. The former high school football captain doubled down, adding services such as data centers to the company's repertoire, and took the business private in 2005, selling 70% of the shares to a subsidiary of Carlyle Group for nearly $1 billion. In 2010, Stone took a resurgent SS&C public again; he remains the firm's largest individual shareholder today.
