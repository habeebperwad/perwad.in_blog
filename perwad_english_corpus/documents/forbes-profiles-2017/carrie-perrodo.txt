			Singapore native Ka Yee (Carrie) Wong was a top model when she met French entrepreneur Hubert Perrodo in the early 1970s. At the time Perrodo was traveling the world drilling for oil and gas. Soon they got married.  Sharing the entrepreneurial bug, Carrie launched her own agency, Carrie's Models, while Hubert started his first business. In time Hubert Perrodo formed Perenco, which has become one of the world's biggest family-owned oil companies with operations in Gabon, Peru, Vietnam and elsewhere. Estimated revenues were $2.4 billion in 2016. Hubert and Carrie enjoyed the good life; he was a keen polo player and wine lover who bought up Bordeaux vineyards, including Chateau Labegorce. Hubert died in 2006 while hiking in the Alps. His fortune was split among Carrie and their three children: Francois, Nathalie and Bertrand. Francois now chairs Perenco and likes to race cars. Nathalie oversees the wine investments. Though French nationals, the family operates out of London. Carrie sold Carrie's Models years ago, but the agency remains active.
