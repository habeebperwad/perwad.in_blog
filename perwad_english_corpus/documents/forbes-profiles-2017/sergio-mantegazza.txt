			Vacation king Sergio Mantegazza has built a tour and travel empire from Globus, the company his father Antonio founded in 1928 with a single gondola that ferried tourists around Lake Lugano. Today, the travel group includes European river cruises and guided tours in the U. S., the UK, Canada, Australia, and South Africa. Mantegazza also owns a significant stake in his family's collection of residential and commercial Lugano real estate and a substantial portfolio of low-risk bonds. In 2014, he sold his flagging Monarch Airlines to Greybull Capital for Â£75 million. On his "Lady Marina" yacht, Mantegazza has played host to high profile guests that reportedly have included Tina Turner.
