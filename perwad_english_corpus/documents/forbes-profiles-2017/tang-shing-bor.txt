			Tang Shing-bor, known fondly as Uncle Bor, made his mark in real estate first when he built a portfolio of hundreds of shops, earning him the nickname, "Shop King."  A deep industry recession and a subsequent change in government policy to encourage the gentrification of the city's gritty industrial areas led him to industrial buildings.  Shopping malls and hotels followed. He owns 15 industrial buildings and shopping malls, plus numerous retail shops in prime shopping districts.
