			Joe Ricketts has made a fortune by letting other people pick stocks. His company, TD Ameritrade, revolutionized the brokerage industry by bringing discounted online trading to the masses. Ricketts, the son of a Nebraska carpenter, started working as a janitor's assistant in third grade.  Eventually, he graduated Creighton University and began a career as a stockbroker. In 1983, he launched his own firm, Ameritrade, which merged with a small online brokerage twelve years later. The combined company went public in 1997, then grew even larger with a $2.9 billion acquisition of TD Waterhouse in 2006. Today TD Ameritrade executes roughly 400,000 trades per day, bringing in over $3 billion in annual revenue. Ricketts retired from the board in 2011 and now spends his time focusing on political and philanthropic giving. His family are the majority owners of the Chicago Cubs, who won the World Series in November 2016 after a 108-year drought.
