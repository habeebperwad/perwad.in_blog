			Antti Herlin is chairman of Kone Corporation, where his grandfather invested in 1924. It is now one of the world's biggest makers of elevators and escalators, with its products appearing around the world in such places as Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Makkah Clock Royal Tower hotel in Saudi Arabia.  He was CEO from 1996 to 2006. During his tenure, he expanded operations through a series of acquisitions, alliances and technological advancements. As a reward, his father Pekka changed his will in 1999 to give Antti control of the firm. After his father's death, three of his siblings sued him over his larger stake. The dispute was resolved in 2005 when they agreed to divvy up the assets with Antti maintaining control of Kone but giving up his stake in its spinoff Cargotec, a cargo machinery and solutions outfit. Antti is also the chairman of Security Trading Oy. He holds shares in Finnish media firm Sanoma.
