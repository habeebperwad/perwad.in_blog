			Jose Roberto Marinho and his two billionaire brothers, Joao Roberto and Roberto Irineu Marinho, inherited control of Globo, Latin America's largest media group. The conglomerate began in Rio de Janeiro in 1925 when their grandfather, Irineu Marinho, launched a newspaper.  Irineu died only 25 days after the first issue of the newspaper was published, leaving the company to his oldest son, the late Roberto Marinho, who built it into the media conglomerate it is today. Globo was rebranded as "Grupo Globo," which includes Brazil's largest broadcaster Rede Globo, Infoglobo, Brazil's largest newspaper company and Globosat, the largest Pay TV provider in Latin America. Jose Roberto leads the family's philanthropy efforts through the Roberto Marinho Foundation, which plays an active role in the cultural renaissance in Rio with the establishment of the Museum of Art of Rio (MAR) the Museum of Tomorrow and the new Museum of Image and Sound on Copacabana Beach.
