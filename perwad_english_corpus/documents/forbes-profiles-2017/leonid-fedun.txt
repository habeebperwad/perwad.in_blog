			A former military man-turned-financial whiz, Leonid Fedun met Vagit Alekperov in the late 1980s while teaching in the Siberian city of Kogalym. At the time, Alekperov headed the local oil and gas company.  In the 1990s Fedun helped him privatize Lukoil, which was formed from top Russian oil properties. Alekperov is now CEO of Lukoil, while Fedun works as his right hand man. He also oversees the investing activities of diversified holding company IFD Kapital, in which they are both investors. Fedun built a $500 million stadium for his Moscow soccer team, Spartak, in 2014. It will apparently host some World Cup matches in 2018.
