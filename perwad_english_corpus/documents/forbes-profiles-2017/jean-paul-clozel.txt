			Shares of Clozel's Swiss pharmaceutical firm, Actelion, surged following Johnson & Johnson's announced $30 billion takeover bid in January 2017. The cardiologist cofounded the company in 1997 with his wife, Martine, and three other colleagues.  Actelion makes drugs for orphan diseases, which affect fewer than 200,000 people and typically receive little research funding.
