			Son of a Bangkok street vendor, Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi controls Thai Beverage, Thailand's largest brewer, famous for its Chang beer and Sang Som rum. He took Thai Bev public in Singapore in 2006 after attempts to list in Thailand were derailed by protests against the promotion of alcohol.  Other big assets include privately held property firm TCC Land and Singapore beverage and property giant Fraser & Neave, which he snatched in 2013 after a battle with Indonesian billionaire Mochtar Riady's Overseas Union Enterprise. Charoen has lately been on a dealmaking spree to expand his retail empire and spent more than $6 billion in 2016 to acquire hypermarket chain Big C Supercenter.
