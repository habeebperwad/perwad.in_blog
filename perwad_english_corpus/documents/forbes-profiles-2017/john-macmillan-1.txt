			John MacMillan and 13 other billionaire relatives control Cargill Inc., the largest private company in America. The Cargill-MacMillan clan has more billionaires than any other family in the world, Forbes has found.  All are descendants of W.W. Cargill, the son of a Scottish sea captain who founded the business as a one-grain storage warehouse at the end of an Iowa railroad line back in 1865. He made a fortune as railroads continued to push westward, opening up the stretch of land that still feeds America today. Today his company looks nothing like it did two-and-a-half centuries ago. Now it is a global food powerhouse, dominating all roads between the farm and your dinner plate. Cargill sells food, processes crops, trades commodities, sources ingredients and offers financial risk management. The family still owns nearly all of the company, which distributes 20% of its earnings to shareholders.
