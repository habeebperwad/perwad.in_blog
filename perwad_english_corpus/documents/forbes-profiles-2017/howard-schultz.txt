			Through Starbucks, Howard Schultz has experimented with promoting better race relations and youth workplace preparedness. He also gives employees a chance to obtain a college degree. No surprise from a guy who grew up in a Brooklyn housing project and whose dad, a cloth-diaper delivery driver, fell on the job and had no insurance or salary.  Schultz went to Northern Michigan University on a football scholarship and was the first in his family to graduate from college. He purchased Starbucks in 1987. "I'm still this kid from Brooklyn who wanted to fight his way out," he says. His focus on social change has not slowed down the company. Starbucks shares are up about fivefold since he returned as CEO in 2008 after an 8-year hiatus.
