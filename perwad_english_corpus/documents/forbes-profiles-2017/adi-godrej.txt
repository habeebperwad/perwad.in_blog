			Patriarch Adi Godrej chairs the 120-year-old Godrej Group, a $4.6 billion (revenue) consumer-goods conglomerate. He also oversees Godrej Consumer Products, which boosted its presence in Africa with the acquisition of 3 personal-care companies in Zambia, Senegal and Kenya.  His son Pirojsha was recently elevated as chairman of listed real estate developer Godrej Properties sparking speculation about succession. The Godrej group was established by lawyer Ardeshir Godrej, who gave up his profession to make locks in 1897. His brother Pirojsha went on to acquire a vast parcel of land in suburban Mumbai that remains the family's biggest asset to this day. An MIT grad, Adi returned home to join the family business in 1963 and took charge as chairman in 2000.
