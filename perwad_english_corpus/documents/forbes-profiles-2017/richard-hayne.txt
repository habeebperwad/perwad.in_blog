			Former hippie Richard Hayne opened his first apparel shop with his ex-wife in the mid-70s near the University of Pennsylvania with only $4,000. Today, Urban Outfitters is a nationwide chain with more than 200 locations and over $3 billion in revenue.  Hayne, Urban Outfitter's chairman, became the company's CEO in 2012 after former CEO Glen Senk left to run New York-based jeweler and watchmaker David Yurman. Urban Outfitters, which targets teens and young adults, has been at the center of controversy over the years, and its products have offended a wide swath of America, including the transgender and gay communities, Navajos, Irish Americans and Jews. Together, they also own the 700-acre Doe Run Dairy farm in Pennsylvania, which produces cheese. Hayne's wife Margaret sits on Urban Outfitters' board and is CEO of wholly-owned brand Free People.
