			Mumbai brothers Shashi & Ravi Ruia, who control the $27 billion (revenue) Essar Group, a steel-to-shipping conglomerate, inked a long-pending deal to sell their Essar Oil and a port to Russian oil-producer Rosneft at an enterprise value of close to $13 billion.  The sale is awaiting regulatory and other approvals. They still own the profitable Stanlow oil refinery in the U.K.through privately held Essar Energy. The siblings are also negotiating with a consortium of banks to restructure their steel company Essar Steel's $4.5 billion debt. The Ruias are said to be looking for a buyer for their outsourcing unit Aegis.
