			Anna Maria Braun is president of the Asian/Pacific region for medical products company B. Braun Melsungen AG. Her father, Ludwig Georg Braun, took over B. Braun in 1977 -- when the company pulled in just $ 24 million in annual sales -- and turned it into one of the world's largest medical device manufacturers.  Employing some 54,000 people globally and generating around $6.5 billion in annual revenue, the company has four divisions: Hospital Care, whose products include infusion and injection solutions; Aesculap, a manufacturer of surgical instruments and devices; OPM (outpatient market), which sells medical products to practitioners outside of the hospital market; and Avitum, a provider of dialysis and other technologies relating to blood treatment. Anna Maria, who owns just over 10% of the company, joined the management board in April 2016.
