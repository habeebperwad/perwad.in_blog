			Aloys Wobben's Enercon is one of the world's largest producers of wind turbines. It had a global market share of 7.8% as of 2014, making it the fifth largest producer behind Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems, China's Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co, GE Wind and Siemens, according to Navigant Consulting Inc.  It is by far the biggest player in Germany, controlling almost 50% of the market. The company does not cater to the U.S. market, India or China, and focuses solely on on-shore wind parks. In contrast  to some of its competitors, Enercon not only produces and sets up wind turbines but also offers service programs for its plants for the duration of their operation. A man of strong opinions, Wobben spoke out against the Iraq war and doesn't lament his company's lack of presence in the U.S. "I wouldn't enjoy supplying wind turbines to a nation so that it can supply water for huge golf courses," he once remarked in an interview. In October 2012, Wobben, known as "Mr. Wind" in Germany, transferred his 100% stake in Enercon into a family trust and announced he was retiring from business for health reasons. Wobben's nephew, Simon-Hermann Wobben, is on the company's board.
