			A chartered accountant, John Reece joined chemicals conglomerate Ineos in 2000, less than two years after the company's founding. Formerly a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he specialized in working with chemicals companies, Reece is now the chief financial officer and minority shareholder at Ineos.  The $40 billion (sales) company produces everything from specialty chemicals to plastics and insulation, and is poised to become one of the largest players in the U.K. shale gas industry with production fields in the North Sea and exploration areas in England and Scotland. Reece graduated from Cambridge with a degree in economics.
