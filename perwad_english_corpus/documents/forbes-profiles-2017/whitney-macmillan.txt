			Whitney MacMillan was the last member of the Cargill-MacMillan family to serve as CEO of America's largest private company, Cargill. His great-grandfather W.W. Cargill founded the business as a single grain warehouse on the end of an Iowa railroad line in 1865. His descendants still own roughly 90% of the company, which took in $107 billion of revenue in 2016 selling food, processing crops, trading commodities, sourcing ingredients and offering financial risk management.  MacMillan sold his 50,000-acre Montana ranch in May 2016 for an undisclosed sum. The ranch, which was listed for $21.5 million, once hosted Lewis and Clark on their journey across the west.
