			George Ty's GT Capital Holdings has interests in banking, auto, property development, power generation and insurance. The group is taking a bigger bet on the infrastructure boom after exiting some of its power investments.  Ty's publicly traded Metrobank, the country's second-largest bank (assets), has been increasing its domestic presence and boasts 945 branches around the Philippines. Ty also owns hotels under the Grand Hyatt and Marco Polo brands. At age 19 Ty was refused a bank loan to start a business; his difficulties spurred him to start his own bank a decade later.
