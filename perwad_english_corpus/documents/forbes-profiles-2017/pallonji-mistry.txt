			Reclusive Indian-born tycoon Pallonji Mistry controls Mumbai-headquartered engineering and construction giant, 152-year-old Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is run by his older son Shapoor. The family's biggest asset is an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, the holding outfit of the $103 billion (revenue) Tata Group, a conglomerate of more than 100 companies.  Mistry's younger son Cyrus is embroiled in a legal battle with the Tata group after he was suddenly ousted as chairman of Tata Sons, a position he had held since 2012.
