			J. Christopher Reyes runs Chicago-based food and beverage distributor Reyes Holdings with his brother Jude Reyes. The brothers are moving the company into production for the first time. In April 2016, Reyes Holdings said it would acquire 6 Coca-Cola bottling facilities for an undisclosed price.  This follows a 2015 move into soda distribution when the company signed a deal to be an exclusive Coca-Cola distributor in the greater Chicago area. The other divisions include Reyes Beverage Group, the largest beer distributor in the U.S.; Martin-Brower, the biggest food distributor to McDonald's; and food distributor Reinhart Foodservice. Reyes Holdings got its start when the family bought a small South Carolina beer distributor for $740,000 in 1976. Jude and Christopher own the company along with brother David "Duke" Reyes. Brothers James and Tom Reyes are executives at Reyes' beverage division.
