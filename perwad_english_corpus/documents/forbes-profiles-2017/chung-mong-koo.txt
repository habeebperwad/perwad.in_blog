			He is the second son of the late Chung Ju-Yung, the eldest son of a peasant farming family who, after the Korean War, repaired trucks for the U.S. Army and went on to assemble a conglomerate that, as much as any, set Korea on the path to becoming an export powerhouse and one of Asia's largest economies.  Most of his eight sons, at his discretion, wound up presiding over various fiefdoms within Hyundai. Chung Mong-Koo took the reins of Hyundai Motor, while his younger brother Chung Mong-Joon, also a billionaire, wound up running Korea's leading shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries. Chung Mong-Koo's billionaire son and presumed successor, Chung Eui-Sun, is vice chairman of Hyundai Motor. The hard-charging chairman -- who is known for his obsession with quality and has driven a rapid expansion of production into new markets such as China, Mexico and Brazil -- shows no sign of retiring. He owns about 4% of Hyundai Motor. Most of his fortune, however, is derived from stakes in publicly traded affiliates Hyundai Steel, auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis and logistics company Hyundai Glovis
