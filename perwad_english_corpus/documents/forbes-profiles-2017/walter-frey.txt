			Walter Frey's fortune stems from his father, Emil. The elder Frey opened an automotive repair shop in 1926 at age 26 and expanded his interests into the Emil Frey group, one of the largest auto importers in Europe with operations in service, dealerships and financing.  Like his father, Walter began race car driving and took several Swiss championships in the '70s. Today, Walter controls the company, but his interests also extend to politics and sports. He served as a member of the Swiss parliament from 1987 to 2001. Walter is also president of Zurich ice hockey club ZSC Lions, and in 2016 donated $12 million to help fund the construction of a new arena, expected to open in 2022. He once held a 50% stake in now-defunct free weekly Zurich newspaper Zuri-Woche, and sat on the board of Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche.
