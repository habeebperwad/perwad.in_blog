			Bharat Desai founded IT consulting and outsourcing company Syntel with his wife Neerja Sethi from their apartment in Troy, Mich. The husband-and-wife team, who met in the U.S. while working for pioneering IT firm, Tata Consulting Services, invested $2,000 to get it going; it brought in $30,000 in sales during its first year.  Thirty-seven years later, Syntel generated nearly $1 billion in 2016 revenue and has nearly 24,000 employees across the globe. Desai, who remains Syntel's chairman, was born in Kenya, raised in India and came to the U.S. in 1976 as a programmer for Tata; he earned his MBA from the University of Michigan. Sethi was born and raised in India, came to the states in 1978. She received her MBA from the University of Delhi before earning her second master's in computer science at Oakland University. She sits on Syntel's board and continues to serve as its vice president of corporate affairs. In 2017 Sethi fell from the billionaires rank as Syntel's shares took a sharp plunge in late 2016 and have yet to rebound; her stake in the company wasn't enough to put her among the world's richest. The fall has been attributed, in part, to the new Trump administration and the uncertainty surrounding financial services and health care firms, key industries that Syntel relies on.
