			Jimmy Haslam is the CEO of Pilot Flying J, the once-battered truck stop company that admitted to defrauding its customers in a $92 million settlement with the Department of Justice in July 2014. Since then Haslam has overhauled the company in hopes of preventing similar problems in the future.  At the same time volatile oil prices have helped boost margins on fuel and attracted more customers inside stations. His father started the company in 1958. His brother Bill, also a billionaire, served as president of Pilot until 1999 and was elected governor of Tennessee in 2010. Today Jimmy shares his fortune with his wife Dee, the CEO of RIVR Media, which has produced hits such as Trading Spaces and the World Series of Poker. Jimmy lived a relatively quiet life until he bought the Cleveland Browns for roughly $990 million in 2012.
