			Sanford "Sandy" Weill spent decades developing his singular vision of banking. He saw it as something akin to a supermarket, a one-stop shop for any financial craving, and from that, Citigroup was created.  Weill landed his first job as a Bear Stearns runner in 1955, earning $150 a week. He formed a brokerage firm with partners, built it into Shearson Loeb Rhoads, and sold it to American Express for nearly $1 billion in 1981. He later created insurance giant Travelers Group through acquisitions and merged it with Citicorp in 1998 in a $76 billion deal, making the newly-named Citigroup one of the world's largest financial services companies. He was CEO until 2003 and chairman until 2006, and the group's success landed Weill on The Forbes 400 list for many years during the 2000s. When Citigroup almost perished in the 2009 financial crisis and needed a government handout to survive, Weill fell off The Forbes 400. In 2012, Weill told CNBC that the big banks should be broken up. They weren't, obviously, but recovering Citi shares have restored his place among the billionaire ranks.
