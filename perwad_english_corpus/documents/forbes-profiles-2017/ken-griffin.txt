			Ken Griffin's Citadel bounded back after a rough start to 2016 when its main hedge fund lost money. By the end of 2016 Citadel had rebounded and its main hedge fund had returned about 5% net of fees. Its Global Fixed Income hedge fund returned about 12% in 2016. Griffin's Chicago-based hedge fund firm now manages $26 billion.  It has been around for 26 years and its main multi-strategy fund has posted annualized net returns of 19% since inception. Griffin's Citadel Securities market-making business has also performed well, executing some 20% of consolidated volume in equities in the U.S. Griffin has made about $500 million in philanthropic contributions, including a $12 million donation in 2016 to repair Chicago's 18-mile iconic Lakefront trail. He has also given $150 million to Harvard to provide scholarships to hundreds of students per year.
