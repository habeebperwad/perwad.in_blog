			Uber chairman Garrett Camp cofounded the taxi-killing startup with Travis Kalanick; the company has reached a $68 billion valuation in just seven years; FORBES estimates that Camp owns just over 9% of the company.  The Uber mobile phone app lets users request a ride and a driver-contractor is routed to pick them up -- with Uber always getting a cut of the fare. In June 2016, the company raised a massive $5.5 billion financing round that included a large investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. But Uber isn't winning everywhere. In July 2016, it admitted defeat in China, striking a deal that gives it 20% of rival Didi Chuxing in exchange for leaving the country. The move eliminated a burden on the company's finances that would have hurt it in a future initial public offering. Before Uber, Garrett Camp founded web discovery tool StumbleUpon, which he sold to eBay in 2007 for $75 million. In mid-2015, he bought back a majority stake of StumbleUpon and said he will be advising its management team. In addition to working at Uber, Camp is also a founder of startup incubator Expa Studios.
