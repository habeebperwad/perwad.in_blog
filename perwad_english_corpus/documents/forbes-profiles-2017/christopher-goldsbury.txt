			San Antonio Billionaire Christopher "Kit" Goldsbury is still as reclusive as ever, but his downtown Pearl neighborhood is abuzz with activity. Goldsbury is backing the Pearl through his private equity firm Silver Ventures, which he founded after selling Pace Foods, producer of Pace Picante salsa, to Campbell Soup in 1994 for $1.12 billion.  Goldsbury began working at Pace in 1969, two years after marrying founder David Pace's daughter, Linda Pace. He started as a vegetable preparer on the assembly line, then moved to the sales division. In 1977 he became president of the company, and five years later he and Linda bought the entire business from the family for just $14 million. After he and Linda separated in 1987, Goldsbury purchased her half for $95 million. He bought the 22-acre site of the former Pearl Brewery through Silver Ventures in 2001. The development now has a string of shops, upscale restaurants, offices and apartments. After a $35 million donation from Goldsbury, it is also home to the Culinary Institute of America, San Antonio.
