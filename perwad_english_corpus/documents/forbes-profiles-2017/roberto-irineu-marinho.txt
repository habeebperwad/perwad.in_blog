			Roberto Irineu Marinho and his two billionaire brothers, Joao Roberto and Jose Roberto Marinho, inherited control of Globo, Latin America's largest media group. The conglomerate began in Rio de Janeiro in 1925 when their grandfather, Irineu Marinho, launched a newspaper.  Irineu died only 25 days after the first issue of the newspaper was published, leaving the company to his oldest son, the late Roberto Marinho, who built it into the media conglomerate it is today. Globo was rebranded in 2014 as "Grupo Globo," which includes Brazil's largest broadcaster Rede Globo, Infoglobo, Brazil's largest newspaper company and Globosat, the largest pay TV provider in Latin America. Roberto Irineu, the eldest brother, is the company's chairman. He owns Sertaozinho Farm, which produces the Orfeu gourmet coffee.
