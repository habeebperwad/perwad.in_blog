			Lang Walker has been in the building industry for more than half a century and has had multiple successes. He sold the bulk of his property-development company, Walker Corp., twice: in 1999 before the dot-com bust, then again in 2006, just before the financial crisis hit.  He has since quickly rebuilt an empire that now has office towers, industrial estates and residential projects. He owns a fleet of yachts, all called Kokomo after his childhood dinghy.
