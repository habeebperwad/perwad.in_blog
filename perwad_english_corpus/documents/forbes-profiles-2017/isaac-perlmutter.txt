			Marvel CEO Isaac "Ike" Perlmutter is a veteran of Israel's 1967 Six-Day War. He immigrated with $250 in his pocket. He landed in Brooklyn, where he sold toys on the streets but -- ever the entrepreneur -- kept looking for opportunities.  While running a toy company that sold Marvel products, he saw Marvel on the decline and tried to persuade owner (and fellow billionaire) Ron Perelman to go into movies. Perelman didn't, and eventually Marvel filed for bankruptcy. In 1998 Perlmutter beat out billionaire Carl Icahn for control of Marvel. After reviving the action-hero company, he sold a majority to Disney in 2009 for $4 billion in cash and stock.
