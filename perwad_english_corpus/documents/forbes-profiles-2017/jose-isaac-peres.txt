			Jose Issac Peres founded Multiplan, one of the largest shopping mall operators in Brazil. While still a student pursuing his bachelor's in economics, Peres started dabbling in Rio de Janeiro's real estate market in 1963, creating real estate company Veplan, which he took public less than a decade later.  Now dubbed Multiplan, the firm owns 18 shopping centers around Brazil with more than 5,400 stores and registering a flow of about 180 million consumers a year. In 2014, Peres' Village Mall property in Rio de Janeiro became the site of Brazil's first official Apple Store. His wife Maria Helena is also one of the largest shareholders of Multiplan.
