			Indian-born plastics tycoon, Aloke Lohia, is the son of an Indian entrepreneur and younger brother of Sri Prakash Lohia, one of Indonesia's richest and also a billionaire. He runs $7.3 billion (revenue) Indorama Ventures, the world's largest polyester company by capacity.  Indorama has been on an acquisition spree of late to expand its global footprint, picking up such assets as BP's petrochemicals plant in Alabama. Bullish on his country of origin, Lohia formed a joint venture in 2016 with India's Dhunseri Petrochem to make polyester resin in eastern India. He installed a 58,600 square-meter solar panel plant at Indorama's factory, Thailand's largest for self-consumption.
