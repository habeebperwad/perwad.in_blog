			Long before he was a presidential candidate (in 1992 and 1996), H. Ross Perot Sr. was the son of a cotton broker from Texarkana and a salesman at IBM. He quit Big Blue when they wouldn't give him more computers to sell after he hit his annual quota by March.  In 1962 he founded Electronic Data Systems, and netted about $1.5 billion selling it to GM. in 1984. In 1986 he was a key investor in Steve Jobs' NEXT computer company. Later he launched Perot Systems, which Dell bought for $3.9 billion in 2009. Long a champion of POW/MIA efforts, in 1978 he recruited military vets to rescue two EDS employees imprisoned in Iran, a saga recounted in Ken Follett's "On Wings of Eagles."
