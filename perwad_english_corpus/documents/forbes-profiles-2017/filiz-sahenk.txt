			Feliz Sahenk manages the branded clothing and tourism components of family conglomerate Dogus Holding, which also encompasses media, construction, energy, real estate and auto import and distribution businesses.  In Turkey, Dogus represents brands such as Gucci, Emporio Armani, Loro Piana, In-Formal and Tod's. In 2012 it formed d.ream (Dogus Restaurant Entertainment and Management), which now encompasses around 170 outlets operating under restaurant brands developed internally as well as through partnerships with the likes of Azumi Group, whose brands include Coya, Roka, Zuma and Oblix. Flush with proceeds from selling 15% of Garanti Bank to the Spanish BBVA for more than $2 billion in 2014, the family has bet big on high-end European tourism. Dogus bought Astir Palace and the Athens Hilton in Greece, the D-Resort Sibenik in Croatia and the Capri Palace in Capri, Italy. It also added to its collection the Hotel Villamagna in Madrid and the Aldrovandi Palace, located in Rome's luxurious Paroli area and known as "heaven in the middle of Rome." In early 2017 the family announced the sale, for around $920 million, of its remaining 10% in Garanti. Feliz Sahenk is president of the foundation established in the name of her father, Dogus founder Ayhan Sahenk. Her brother Ferit Sahenk and mother Deniz Sahenk are also billionaires.
