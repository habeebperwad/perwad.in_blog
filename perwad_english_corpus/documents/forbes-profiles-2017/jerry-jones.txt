			The former co-captain of the University of Arkansas 1964 national championship team, Jerry Jones has long had football in his blood. In 1989 he bought the Dallas Cowboys for $150 million--the team is now worth $4.2 billion.  Jones made a name for himself as an oil wildcatter and still invests heavily in drilling opportunities, as well as lucrative retail and residential real estate development projects in the North Dallas suburbs. An avid art collector, he acquired Norman Rockwell's painting "Coin Toss" at the same time he bought the Cowboys, but Jones is still chasing the kind of on-the-field success he had in the early 1990s.
