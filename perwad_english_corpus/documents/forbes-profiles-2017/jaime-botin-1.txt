			Jaime Botin is the largest shareholder of Spanish bank Bankinter S.A. and a member of the most successful banking family in Spanish history. Jaime's great grandfather founded Spain's largest bank, Santander.  His grandfather, father, and brother Emilio have all been presidents of the bank. In the late 1990s Jaime served as vice chairman of Santander while his brother was chairman. Jaime left the role in 2004 and continued to increase his stake in Bankinter. He now owns a 24% stake in the bank through his holding company Cartival S.A. Jaime is married with five children. Authorities reportedly seized a $28 million Picasso from his yacht in 2015, contending that he was trying to sell a national treasure abroad. He said he owned it, and it was his right to do whatever he wanted with it. Litigation over the piece continues today.
