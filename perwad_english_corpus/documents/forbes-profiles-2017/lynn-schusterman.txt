			n 2011 Lynn Schusterman decided to sell oil company Samson Resources to a K.K.R-led group for $7.2 billion. Much of the windfall, $2.3 billion, went to the Charles & Lynn Schusterman Foundation, devoted to Jewish charities, including Birthright Israel, and education projects in Tulsa.  The family held onto a few oil and gas assets along the Gulf Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, and rolled them into Samson Energy, run by Lynn's daughter Stacy. Lynn splits her time between homes in Tulsa, New York and Jerusalem. Her late husband Charles Schusterman built the fortune from scratch.
