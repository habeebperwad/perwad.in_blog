			John Whittaker runs the Peel Group, a large British conglomerate that holds stakes in property, media and infrastructure businesses.  Known as a visionary with a penchant for regeneration projects, Whittaker got his start in the 1970s acquiring cotton mills for their land.   He's in the midst of his most ambitious project yet, a 50-year, $73 billion plan to transform a 50-mile corridor encompassing Liverpool and Manchester.  The project will build parks, wind farms, retail and residential developments, and revitalize docks.  His group also developed several of Britain's best-known buildings, including MediaCityUK and Trafford Centre mall.  The latter was sold to Capital Shopping Centres in return for a nearly one-fourth stake in the group.  Peel owned a majority stake in Pinewood Shepperton, which includes the famous U.K. studio that filmed the James Bond and Harry Potter movies, until it was taken private in August 2016. The Manchester-native now lives in a mansion on the Isle of Man.
