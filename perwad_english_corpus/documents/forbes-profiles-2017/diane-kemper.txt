			New York City real estate heiress Diane Kemper is one of four Goldman siblings to equally split ownership of Solil Management, which owns at least 400 properties across New York City, from retail and office space along Madison Avenue in midtown, to high-end coops on the Upper East Side and a 17% stake in the World Trade Center developments in lower Manhattan.  Diane is the second-oldest child of late patriarch Sol Goldman, who started buying up foreclosed properties for bargain prices in the 1950s. Sol's trademark was all-cash deals whenever possible. His low-profile children, Solil acting chair Jane, co-chair Allan Goldman and senior advisers Diane and Amy have preserved his investments, rarely selling. Diane headed the residential leasing department for several decades, when she scaled back due to health issues several years ago.
