They cofounded health insurance and medical care firm Amil in 1972, and sold a 90% stake in the company to U. S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group in 2012 for $4.9 billion in cash. Dulce also owns a stake in Dasa, a publicly-traded chain of medical laboratories in Latin America. She received a PhD in management from McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin and was an assistant professor in the pediatrics department at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, where she also served as academic dean of the undergraduate program.
