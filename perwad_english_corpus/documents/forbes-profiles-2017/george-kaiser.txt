			The core of George Kaiser's fortune is Bank of Oklahoma, which he bought out of federal receivership in 1991 or $60 million. The origin of his fortune is oil and gas. In the 1930s his mother and father fled Nazi Germany and settled in Tulsa, where his uncle founded Kaiser-Francis Oil Company.  George took over in the late 1960s. Though his assets took a hit in the oil bust, his Cactus drilling rig company enjoyed an early 2017 resurgence in west Texas. His private equity holdings include a stake in India's Bombay Stock Exchange and innovative printing company Memjet. He acquired a 20% stake in NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder in 2014. Kaiser has endowed the George Kaiser Family Foundation and Tulsa Community Foundation with more than $4 billion.
