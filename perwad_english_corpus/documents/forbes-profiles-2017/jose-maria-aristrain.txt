			Jose Maria Aristrain is the former owner of giant steelmaker Arcelor and now holds a 2% stake of ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel company. Its shares tumbled in the early 2010s but have seen a slow recovery.  He's also a shareholder of Spain's Tubacex, the second-largest global manufacturer of seamless stainless steel tubes. In 2016, Spain's public ministry accused Aristrain of defrauding the public treasury of 211 million euro, the greatest fiscal crime in Spain's history. He faces 64 years in jail and 1.4B euros in fines if convicted.
