His London-listed NMC Health, one of UAE's largest hospital chains, acquired Al Zahra Hospital in Sharjah for $560 million last December.  His holding outfit, BRS Ventures, announced a $1.8 billion investment with the Andhra Pradesh state government for projects in healthcare, hospitality and education. Shetty's other interests include generics firm Neopharma which has tied up with Pfizer and Merck Serono for contract manufacturing.
