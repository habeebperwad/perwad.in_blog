			The son of a holocaust survivor, Alan Trefler worked as a teen at his father's small furniture business. In 1975, when he was a sophomore at Dartmouth College, he won the World Open Chess Tournament. At age 27, he started Pegasystems, a software company that focused on streamlining business and enhancing customer engagement.  The company, which went public in 1996, now brings in $750 million in revenue and employs more than 4,000 people. In his book Build for Change, Trefler claims that a lot of companies are going to die because customers hate doing business with them, a predicament Trefler calls "customerpocalypse." Alan and his wife Pamela are founders and trustees of the Trefler Foundation, through which they have donated to public education and youth development in Boston. Chess remains a big passion for the Massachusetts native. In 2010, Pegasystems sponsored a fundraising event where Trefler faced off against chess titan Gary Kasparov and future world champion Magnus Carlsen. He has also recently taken up table tennis at MIT.
