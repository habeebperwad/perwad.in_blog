			Ofer Investments chairwoman Liora Ofer owns a controlling stake in Ofer Investments, which was founded by her father Yuli Ofer and uncle Sammy Ofer, who were once Israel's richest men (both men are now deceased). Ofer Investments owns stakes in publicly-traded Mirahi Tefahot Bank, where Liora Ofer sits on the board of directors, and real estate company Melisron, where she is chairman.  In 2015, Liora Ofer won a years-long court battle between her and her brother Doron Ofer over their inheritance, which left her with 52% of the company following her father's death in 2011. Doron had been suing to get a larger share of the inheritance but was unsuccessful. Liora Ofer is one of just two women billionaires in Israel. Her cousins Eyal and Idan Ofer, sons of the late Sammy Ofer, are also billionaires.
