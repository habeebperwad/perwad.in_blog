			Tony Langley's journey started with the revival of his grandfather's failed engineering firm, F.S. Hunt & Co. The once successful Nottinghamshire, England based mining equipment manufacturer eventually dissolving in 1975. It was then that a 20-year-old Langley decided to pick up what was left of the business and start Langley Mining, which sold equipment to the U. K. coal industry. Joined by his father in 1978, the two navigated the company through a rapidly changing energy sector. Langley began to diversify and in 2000, he bought his first company, Clarke Chapman, a crane manufacturer. After hitting record sales thanks to the acquisition, Langley began buying more non-core, disposable sections of successful corporations. To date, Langley Holdings has made eight acquisitions in total and reached profits of $941 million in 2016.
