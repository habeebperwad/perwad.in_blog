			The first in his family to go to college, John Kapoor came to the U.S. from India to get his Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry. He stepped down as CEO and chairman of opioid manufacturer Insys Therapeutics in January 2017, a month after six former Insys executives (including Kapoor's predecessor as CEO, Michael Babich) were arrested and charged with conspiring to bribe doctors to needlessly prescribe Subsys, a Fentanyl spray approved by the Food & Drug Administration to treat patients with severe cancer pain, according to an indictment filed by the U. S. Attorney's Office of the District of Massachusetts in December. He remains chairman of Akorn, which specializes in "difficult-to-manufacture" prescription drugs. His wife of three decades, Editha, died of breast cancer in 2005. He also owns the Roka Akor Japanese eateries in Chicago, Scottsdale and San Francisco.
