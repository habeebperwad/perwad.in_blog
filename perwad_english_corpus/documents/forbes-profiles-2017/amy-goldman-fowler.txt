			Amy Goldman is the second-youngest daughter of late real estate tycoon Sol Goldman (d. 1987), at one time New York City's biggest landlord. She and three siblings share ownership of their late father's firm, Solil Management, which owns at least 400 New York City properties.  Their portfolio includes high-end Upper East Side apartments, the midtown Manhattan block where the Olympic Tower and the Cartier Mansion are located, the Peninsula Hotel and a 17% stake in three buildings in the new World Trade Center development. A senior adviser at the firm, Amy had worked at the real estate office before earning a P.h.D. in clinical psychology. She is now best-known as a premier heirloom horticulturalist and is also a political megadonor, having given about $2.5 million to Democratic campaigns or super PACs so far this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Amy lives on a 200-acre farm in Rhinebeck, New York, with her husband Dr. Cary Fowler, who helped start climate change conscious Svalbard Global Seed Vault.
