			When Mohed Altrad immigrated to France from Syria in 1969, he didn't speak French and survived on one meal a day. Now he heads Montpellier-based Altrad Group, one of the world's leading manufacturers of scaffolding and cement mixers, with $2.4 billion in revenues and more than 21,000 employees.  Altrad's current station is a world away from his beginnings as an orphaned Bedouin in the Syrian desert. Altrad's mother died when he was around 4, and his father disowned him. He was raised by his grandmother, who banned him from going to school. He attended anyway, eventually winning a scholarship to study in France, where he earned an undergraduate degree in physics and math and a Ph.D. in computer science. After stints at tech firms and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, he bought a bankrupt scaffolding manufacturer in southern France with a partner in 1985. Despite knowing nothing about the industry, he led the firm to turn a profit and has expanded ever since. Altrad also owns a majority stake in Montpellier HÃ©rault Rugby and has written three novels, including semi-autobiographical Badawi. Altrad was named Ernst & Young's World Entrepreneur of the Year in 2016.
