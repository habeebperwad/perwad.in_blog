The bank was founded by the Yarur family in 1937, and today is one of Chile's largest banking institutions with more than $45 billion in assets.  In 2015, Bci purchased Miami-based City National Bank of Florida for $947 million. The acquisition marked the first time a Chilean bank purchased a U.S. financial institution.
