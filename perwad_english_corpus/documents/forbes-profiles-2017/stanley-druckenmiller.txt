			Hedge fund legend Stan Druckenmiller now only manages his own money at his Duquesne family office. As a hedge fund investor for 30 years, he never had a negative return and pulled off some historic trades while working for George Soros, particularly when the duo "broke" the Bank of England with their massive shorting of the pound in 1992. The Pittsburgh native stopped working for Soros Fund Management in 2000, concentrating on his own Duquesne Capital Management until he decided to leave the hedge fund business in 2010. The Bowdoin College grad reportedly ran a hot dog stand in college for extra cash.
