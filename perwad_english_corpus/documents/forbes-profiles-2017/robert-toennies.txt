			Robert Toennies owns 50% of German food industry giant Toennies Lebensmittel. Operating meat, convenience, ingredients and logistics divisions, the company, with annual revenue of around $6 billion, specializes in pig, sow and beef cattle slaughtering, butchering and processing.  It prides itself on efficient, fully automated butchering and on having achieved "biological unity" by bringing slaughtering, butchering and packaging together under one roof, thus ensuring maximum product freshness. Robert's late father, Bernd, and uncle, Clemens, cofounded Toennies Lebensmittel in 1971. It currently employs around 10,000 people in facilities in Germany and Denmark. Since 2012, Robert and Clemens have been engaged in a legal dispute involving shares in the company to which both parties lay claim.
