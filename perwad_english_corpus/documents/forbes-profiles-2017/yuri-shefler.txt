			Yuri Shefler owns S.P.I. Group, which produces and sells alcohol under 380 brands in 160 countries. The company is registered in Luxembourg but its main factories are in Latvia. Its best known brand is Stolichnaya vodka, which Shefler bought from state-owned VVO Soyuzplodoimport for $285,000 in 1997. Soyuzplodoimport later decided it wanted the brand back and sued.  Russia's Supreme Court ruled the sale illegal in 2001, banning Shefler from selling the vodka inside its borders. He was also prosecuted for misappropriation of trademarks. He left Russia the next year but that didn't stop the Russian government from continuing to pursue him. In 2008, he was placed on an Interpol list. In 2014, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium joined Russia in banning sales of Stolichnaya. For now, the troubles haven't hurt business much, according to analysts. Shefler, meanwhile, splits his time between Great Britain, Switzerland and wherever his yacht Serene, one of the largest in the world, takes him.
