			Nearly 14 years after he cofounded professional networking site LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman announced in June 2016 that he was selling the publicly-traded social media company he chairs to Microsoft for $26.2 billion in cash. The announcement came four months after LinkedIn's stock dropped 40% on a single day, following a disappointing full-year growth forecast, and closed in December 2016. Hoffman is also a partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners and has led the firm's investments in Groupon and Airbnb. He sits on the boards of several nonprofits, including Kiva, which seeks to combat poverty through microfinance. The Stanford and Oxford alum co-authored "The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age," a 2014 bestseller that encourages companies and employees to think of each other as "allies on a tour of duty." Hoffman belongs to the so-called "PayPal Mafia," and was one of the first employees at the payment company that was later sold to eBay. Prior to joining PayPal in 1998, Hoffman created the (failed) dating site SocialNet, which some regard as the first online social network.
