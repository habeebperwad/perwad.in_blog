			In 2014, one of the world's largest agricultural processors, Illinois-based Archer-Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), purchased WILD Flavors for around $3 billion in cash. Hans Peter Wild owned the business along with investor group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.  (KKR), which acquired a 35% stake in 2010. Wild's father founded the company in 1931 to provide food and beverage companies with fruit juice concentrates and blends. As a student studying business administration and law, Hans Peter Wild travelled abroad in search of innovative alternative sources of raw materials for the family business. After graduation, he gained managerial experience working for a marketer of mineral oil and chemicals. Joining his father's company in 1974, he expanded the portfolio. WILD became one of the world's leading suppliers of flavors and extracts, colors from natural sources, sweetening systems, seasonings and fermentation technologies. Hans Peter's biggest marketing coup was signing Muhammed Ali, then at the peak of his boxing career, as an advertising spokesman for Capri Sun, a fruit juice drink developed in the 1960s. "I am the greatest. The whole world knows it. But the day I stop boxing, Capri Sun will be greatest," proclaimed Ali. Today, Capri Sun is consumed in more than 100 countries and generates estimated annual sales of $400 million. The brand is owned by by Hans-Peter Wild's Capri-Sun AG, based in Zug, Switzerland, whose assets also include INDAG, which develops and manages processing units as well as machines for the food and beverage industries. Through the Leonie Wild Charitable Foundation, which he established with his mother in 1997, Wild is an active philanthropist in the Eppelheim and Rhine-Neckar region of Germany, helping citizens in need as well as supporting social and cultural projects. Wild donated $16 million to the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation in 2016.
