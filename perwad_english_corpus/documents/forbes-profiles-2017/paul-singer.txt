			Paul Singer's hedge fund firm settled a 15-year battle with the government of Argentina in 2016 over outstanding bond payments, earning his Elliott Management a $2.4 billion dollar profit. Singer's hedge fund posted returns of 13% in 2016 after fees.  Singer founded Elliott Management in 1977 with $1.3 million, and it has since grown to $31 billion in assets under management. Elliott is one of the country's most successful hedge funds, having lost money in only two years since its inception. The firm is known for taking activist positions in publicly-traded companies and agitating for change. Outside of the financial world, Singer is regarded for his political engagement, particularly in support of conservative causes. He has also backed LGBT rights and pro-Israel efforts. He was a large donor in the 2016 U.S. election cycle, giving more than $10 million in support of Republican candidates.
