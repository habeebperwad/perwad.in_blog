			Reclusive paints tycoon Goh Cheng Liang gets the bulk of his wealth from a 39% stake in Japan's Nippon Paint Holdings. The company expanded its footprint in the American market with the December acquisition of Dunn-Edwards, a household paint supplier in Los Angeles, for an estimated $600 million.  Goh's son, Hup Jin, is Nippon's executive director and also runs privately held paint and coatings maker Nipsea, a joint venture with Nippon. Goh started making paints in a small factory in Singapore before he went on to partner Japan's Nippon Paint in 1962. The Gohs collect luxury yachts and catamarans.
