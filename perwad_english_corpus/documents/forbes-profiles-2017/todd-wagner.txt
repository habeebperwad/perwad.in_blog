			The business partner of Mark Cuban, Wagner joined the billionaire ranks after selling Web startup Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999. The sale of the audio and video portal brought in $5.7 billion and didn't just benefit Wagner and Cuban: their 300 employees became millionaires.  Wagner safeguarded his shares against the dot-com bubble's epic burst with put options. Since then Wagner and Cuban have continued to invest together in ventures such as Magnolia Pictures, Landmark Theaters, and AXS TV.
