			Real estate developer Charles Cohen has used his fortune to help fund his passion for movies. He produced the 2008 Oscar-nominated Frozen River and distributed five foreign films nominated by the Academy Awards.  Iran's Salesman, which won an Oscar for best foreign film in 2017, was his first win. Up next: he is executive producer of Benji, a remake of the popular 1987 family movie about a heroic stray dog. Cohen, who bought Merchant Ivory Productions in 2015, also owns the rights to distribute about 800 films.  Other recent deals include picking up a majority stake in Savile Row tailor Richard James in early 2017 and buying Chateau de Chausse near Saint-Tropez in 2016. Cohen joined his family's Cohen Brothers Realty in 1979, two years after graduating from law school. He later bought out his father and uncle, and quadrupled the business to 12 million square feet through more than 70 acquisitions and financings, focusing largely on Manhattan office buildings. He also owns several design centers that have over 600 high end home furnishings showrooms.
