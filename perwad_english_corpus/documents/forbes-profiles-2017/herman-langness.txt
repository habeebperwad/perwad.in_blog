			Fourth-generation owner Hermann Langness presides over one of Germany's largest food wholesale and retail groups. His great-grandfather, a bakery commission agent, founded the business in 1892, in Kiel. In 1928, the company merged with wholesaler Paul Bartels to become Bartels-Langness AG (abbreviated to Bela). Bela Group has been an aggressive acquirer, building up a portfolio of companies in businesses ranging from wine importing and pet food/supplies to bakery wholesale and retail, supermarkets and wholesale distribution to the retail trade.  The $4 billion-plus (revenues) company, which also owns a vineyard, employs over 16,000 people and supplies more than 30,000 products to supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stores. It also operates 111 supermarkets under the brand names famila and Makrant. Langness rarely talks to press and is fiercely private.
