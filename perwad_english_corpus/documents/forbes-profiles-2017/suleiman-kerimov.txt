			A trained economist, Suleiman Kerimov has made a career of investing in distressed companies. He started a diversified investment company, Nafta Moskva, in 1992. Just before the country's financial meltdown in 2008, he sold nearly all of his Russian assets, including shares in energy giant Gazprom and a massive housing development in suburban Moscow.  Kerimov borrowed heavily to buy stakes in Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and others. He soon lost billions, but began investing again in the Russian market with the help of loans from VTB Bank. He bought a stake in Polyus Gold, the nation's largest gold mining outfit; Rostelecom, a leading telecom company; and billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev's stake in Uralkali. In August 2013, Belarusian authorities arrested Uralkali's CEO, saying he abused his power and embezzled funds while his company was involved in a trading alliance with Belaruskali, a government-owned fertilizer company. The authorities said the companies could resume their relationship if Kerimov got rid of his stake, so he sold it to billionaires Mikhail Prokhorov and Dmitry Mazepin. By early 2015, he had sold most of his other assets except the stake in Polyus Gold, which he bought out after borrowing $5.5 billion. A native of Dagestan, Kerimov represents the republic in Russia's Federation Council. To get around a law barring politicians from holding bank accounts and other financial assets abroad, he pledged his assets to a Swiss charity, the Suleyman Kerimov Foundation, and gave shares in Polyus to his son Said when he was age;  Forbes assumes Kerimov is the true owner.
