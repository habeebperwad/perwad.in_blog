			Once considered the Teflon politician, Silvio Berlusconi lost his invincibility. In 2015 the three-time prime minister of Italy was convicted of bribing a former Italian senator, just two years after he was found guilty of tax fraud and sentenced to community service.  The convictions have not dented his wealth. Berlusconi, a media mogul before he entered politics, still has stakes in publisher Mondadori, financial services firm Mediolanum and Italy's largest commercial broadcaster, Mediaset. In August 2016, Berlusconi agreed to sell 80% of A.C. Milan, one of Europe's most successful soccer teams, to Chinese corporation Sino-Europe Sports Investment for a reported $820 million (which includes assumption of about $200 million debt). The sale was supposed to close in December 2016, was postponed until early March 2017, and had not closed as of March 13. Berlusconi got his start as a singer on cruise ships and in nightclubs. In 1961, he graduated with a law degree and went on to found Edilnord, a residential construction and development company in Milan. He poured his earnings into media, importing American shows like Baywatch and the Smurfs, before becoming a politician in 1993. In 2011, he was forced to step down as prime minister and was ousted from Parliament two years later. The fortune includes shares of stock that Berlusconi has transferred to his five sons.
