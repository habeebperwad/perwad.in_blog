			John Grayken is the founder and sole owner of Lone Star Funds, a private equity firm that manages some $70 billion and focuses on distressed assets, often linked to real estate. He has raised 17 funds since 1995 that have produced annual returns of about 20% net of fees.  In 2016, Grayken raised $11.4 billion for two new funds that blew past their fundraising goals. Raised in a suburb south of Boston, Grayken renounced his U.S. citizenship for tax purposes in the 1990s and took Irish citizenship. He bought Boston's most expensive condo for $33 million in 2016, but spends most of his time in London. His firm is headquartered in New York. Exceptionally secretive, Grayken specializes in buying distressed real estate assets all over the world, from the U.S. to Europe and Asia, wherever there is an economic downturn or crisis. The assets Lone Star buys are managed by Hudson Advisors, a firm with 850 employees and based in Dallas that Grayken also owns.
