			Nelson Peltz's main hedge fund returned 11% net of fees  in 2016 on a highly concentrated portfolio that included Bank of New York Mellon, DuPont, General Electric and food conglomerate Mondelez International.  The largest position in his $13 billion Trian Fund Management, restaurant-supply giant Sysco, climbed 37% during 2016 while Wendy's, where Peltz is chairman, rose 27%. Peltz sold off his Pepsico position at a profit last year after failing to break up the company. His $2.5 billion investment in GE has yet to generate much of a return, while he recently boosted his Procter & Gamble holdings to $3 billion in an effort to shake up the company.
