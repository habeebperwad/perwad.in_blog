			Jay Y. Lee, Samsung's vice chairman, was arrested in February 2017 for his role in South Korea's ongoing political scandal involving impeached President Park Geun-Hye. The heir of the sprawling Samsung empire is accused of paying around $38 million in bribes to Park's long time confidante, Choi Soon-Sil, in order to secure the controversial merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, which prosecutors say was intended to consolidate control of the country's largest conglomerate.  Jay Y. Lee denied wrongdoing, maintaining that he never willingly made bribes for preferential government treatment. His trial, which began in March 2017, has the potential to shake up the country, as it hits the heart of the cozy ties between the Korean government and its family-run conglomerates. His arrest comes not long after the massive recall of Samsung's highly anticipated Galaxy Note 7, which stemmed from a critical battery problem that caused units to overheat and explode. The Galaxy Note 7 was Lee's biggest product launch since becoming the company's de facto head after his father, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-Hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014 (he remains incapacitated). The younger Lee is the only son of Kun-Hee and has been groomed for succession since joining Samsung Electronics in 1991. He became president in 2009 and was named vice chairman in 2013.
