			The city's most prominent woman deal-maker, entrepreneur and billionaire, Chu could easily have stepped into her family's hotel and casino business. Or, like many of her peers, made a fortune in the city's lucrative real estate market.  Instead she decided to bet on the region's growing capital markets and launched Kingston Financial Group in 1992. Her wealth has tripled in just the past two years. In 2016 FORBES ranked her at No. 42 on the list of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Leveraging her personal network, the city's proximity to China and a more liberal stock market regime, Chu built Kingston into a financial powerhouse that competes with the Morgan Stanleys and Goldman Sachs of the world for local business. Named for her only son, Kingston boasts a market capitalization of $6 billion; she owns 63%.
