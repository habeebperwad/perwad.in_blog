			Denim genius Renzo Rosso got his start with his mother's sewing machine, making a pair of eccentric bell-bottoms at 15 years old. Since then he has built a global fashion and lifestyle empire. After joining denim guru Adriano Goldschmied at Molex, an Italian manufacturing company, he renamed the firm Diesel in 1978 in a nod to the decade's oil crises.  He bought out Goldschmied's stake in 1985 and created controversial ad campaigns, betting on the rising incomes of style-conscious, rich Wall Street types as customers. He then went on a spending spree, acquiring up-market fashion houses such as Marison Margiela, Viktor & Rolf and Marni. They are all now run under Only the Brave (OTB), a holding company Rosso created in 2002. Rosso owns 90% of OTB - the other 10% is split between his two sons, Andrea and Stefano. He also has a 90% stake in Red Circle, his family's investment vehicle, which owns part of e-commerce firm Yoox-Net-A-Porter, as well as Italian tech incubator H-Farm and a winery near his Italian home.
