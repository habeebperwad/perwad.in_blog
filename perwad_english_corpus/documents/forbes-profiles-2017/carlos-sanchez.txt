			Carlos Sanchez is the chairman and largest shareholder of privately-held EMS S.A., a Brazilian pharmaceutical company that sells prescription, generic, branded generic and over-the-counter products. In recent years, however, the company has benefited from adding drugs including Viagra and Lipitor generics to its sales arsenal.  EMS was founded by Carlos' father, Emiliano, in 1950 as a small pharmacy in Santo Andre, a municipality in southeastern Brazil. Carlos inherited EMS at age 26 after his father's death.
