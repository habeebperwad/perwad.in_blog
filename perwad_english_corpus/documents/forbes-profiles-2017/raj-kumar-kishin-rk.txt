			Father-son pair, Raj Kumar and Kishin RK, are celebrating the 70th anniversary of their Royal Holdings/RB Capital property empire in Singapore with a flurry of new launches. Their 300-room Park Hotel Farrer Park and Farrer Square Medical Suites, both in Little India, along with a 226-room InterContinental Hotel at Robertson Quay are due to open in mid-2017. Their next project is a 60-story commercial tower, located in the Raffles Place business district, that will be among the tallest in Singapore.  Keen to expand overseas, they are scouting for acquisitions in Europe. Raj Kumar's younger brother Asok Hiranandani is also a billionaire and runs his separate property group.
