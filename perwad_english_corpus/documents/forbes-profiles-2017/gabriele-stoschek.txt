			It's not often that the third generation to lead a family company wins glowing accolades for managerial skill and entrepreneurial vision, but that is certainly the case with Gabriele Stoschek's husband Michael Stoschek.   He is the grandson of Max Brose, founder of the namesake German auto-parts maker that Michael Stoschek took over in 1971 at age 23, dismissing his dream of becoming a photographer. Under his leadership, Brose evolved from being a national manufacturer into a world market leader in electrical and mechanical components and integrated systems that are largely invisible to vehicle drivers. It bills itself as the world's fifth-largest family-owned automotive supplier. Approximately 24,000 employees work for the company at 60 locations in 23 countries. Annual revenues top $6.4 billion.
