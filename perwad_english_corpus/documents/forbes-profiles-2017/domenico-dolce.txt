			The Sicilian half of fashion power-duo Dolce & Gabbana, Domenico Dolce was born into the world of fashion, but not into luxury. His father was a tailor near the city of Palermo in Sicily, while his mother sold fabrics and clothing at a store.  He left for Milan, where he studied at Istituto Marangoni, dropping out of the three year course early, believing that he knew everything they were trying to teach him. While working as an assistant designer to Giorgio Correggiari, he met Stefano Gabbana at a club, and eventually got Gabbana a job with Correggiari and became a sort of mentor. By 1983, the pair left Correggiari and were living together in Milan and in a relationship, working on freelance designs until they founded Dolce & Gabbana in 1985. The following year, they made their runway debut at the Milan Fashion Week. Known for their extravagant style and animal print designs, their big breakthrough came in 1993 when Madonna selected them to design costumes for her Girlie tour, exposing them to the masses. Even though their personal relationship ended in 2003, Dolce and Gabbana still design for the company and continue to share ownership of it.
