The Chinese-Malaysian tycoon's Kuok Group controls an empire that includes the high-end hotel chain Shangri-La, Kerry Properties and commodities trader Wilmar.  He got his start trading rice, sugar and wheat flour in Malaysia in 1949 and in Singapore in 1953. A big source of his wealth is a stake in palm-oil-giant Wilmar International, which is run by nephew Kuok Khoon Hong, a Singapore billionaire.
