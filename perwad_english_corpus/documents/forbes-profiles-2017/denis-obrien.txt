			Cell phone tycoon Denis O'Brien runs and owns 94% of Digicel, a mobile phone network provider that operates in the Caribbean and Asia Pacific in Haiti, Panama, El Salvador and Papua New Guinea, among other countries, braving coups, riots and threats of nationalization.  He endears his firm to the masses by cutting prices and donating to local causes. Following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake in Haiti he funded the restoration of Port-au-Prince's 19th-century Iron Market, and his Digicel Foundation built 150 schools. He also cofounded the Front Line Defenders to protect and provide emergency support for human rights activists in danger. The son of a political activist, he once sold horse pills, but had his big break selling his Irish mobile outfit, Esat Telecom Group, to British Telecom Group at height of telecom boom in 2000 for $2.8 billion. He also has investments in media, healthcare and the PGA Catalunya and Quinta do Lago resorts on the Iberian peninsula.
