			Former insurance executive Lachhman Das Mittal started his business career in 1990 at age 65 after retiring from the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India. He expanded his family's business of making agricultural equipment into tractors.  Today his Sonalika Group is India's third-largest tractor maker. Recently Japan's Yanmar increased its holding in the company to 30% by buying out private equity firm Blackstone's 18% stake for $250 million, valuing the firm at $1.4 billion. Mittal, who has handed over operations to his two sons and grandsons, attends office every day.
