Abramov got his start as the head of a research lab before the collapse of the Soviet Union.  In 1992, he founded a precursor to Evraz Holding and made a fortune exporting metals and coal from the Urals and Siberia. After the 1998 Russian financial crisis, he bought up hobbled steel companies and coal mines on the cheap, including two U.S. firms, Claymont Steel and Oregon Steel. In January of 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Abramov the Decoration For Beneficence for his public work and charity activity.
