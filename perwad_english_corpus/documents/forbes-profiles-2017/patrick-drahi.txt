			Patrick Drahi holds nearly 60% of the stock of Altice, the multinational telecommunications company he founded. Following a buy-low, sell high mantra Drahi built Altice around 20 acquisitions of lagging cable and mobile operators, often at knockdown prices in places such as France, Belgium, Israel, Portugal, and the Dominican Republic.  Through the Amsterdam-based Altice he owns 75% of Numericable, France's largest cable operator. In 2015 Altice took its first step into the U.S. by purchasing a 70% stake in cable operator Suddenlink in a $9 billion deal. Drahi, the son of two math teachers, was born in Casablanca, Morocco and emigrated to France as a teenager. He holds an engineering degree from the prestigious Parisian university Ã‰cole Polytechnique and lives in Switzerland with his wife and children.
