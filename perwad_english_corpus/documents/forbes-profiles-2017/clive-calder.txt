			Clive Calder became a billionaire in 2002 when he sold his music company Zomba Group to the German mass media corporation Bertlesmann for $2.7 billion. Although he made his living helping some of music's biggest names reach global success, he has intentionally remained out of the limelight.  Calder lives a quiet life in the Cayman Islands with his wife. He frequently travels to parts of Africa to spend time on philanthropic causes, especially ones that concern the ELMA Philanthropies, which mainly focuses on improving childhood education and health in Africa. Calder, born in Johannesburg, started out playing in a band at age 18 to support his mother and sister after his father's death. He moved to London in 1975 and founded Zomba, whose crown jewel was Jive Records. Calder's firm opened an office in New York City in 1978, signing acts like Billy Ocean, The Cars, Backstreet Boys, R. Kelly, Britney Spears and 'N Sync and many of the first commercially successful hip hop artists.
