			Eyal Ofer inherited part of his late father's shipping empire and has expanded the holdings significantly. He is the chairman of Ofer Global, based in Monaco, and chairman of Zodiac Group, a privately-held Monaco-based shipping firm with more than 150 vessels.  His other shipping interests include privately-held OMNI Offshore Terminals and a stake in publicly-traded Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, where he has been a director for more than 15 years. Ofer is chairman of private real estate investment firm Global Holdings, which owns New York City properties including the Altria Building,15 Central Park West, 1250 Broadway and 50 United Nations Plaza. Eyal and his brother Idan are the sons of shipping magnate Sammy Ofer, who died in 2011 and was once Israel's richest man. Planning for the wealth transfer to the brothers began years before their father's death. It culminated in early 2014 with the legal separation of the two brothers' shipping empires. Eyal has collected a trove of contemporary, impressionist and modern art and inherited half of his father's vast collection, said to be one of the world's most magnificent. He oversees the Eyal & Marilyn Ofer Family Foundation, which donated about $15 million to the Tate Modern gallery in London in 2013.
