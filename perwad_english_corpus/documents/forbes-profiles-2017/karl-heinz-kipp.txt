			Karl-Heinz Kipp made his first fortune in retailing and his second one in real estate. After selling clothes for more than a decade, he opened the first Massa department store in 1965. He sold the chain in 1985, but smartly held on to the underlying property and struck a lucrative lease deal with retailer Metro.  These days, he tends to his Swiss luxury hotel and resort group, which he regards as a passionate hobby and not a source of income. He has three five-star properties: the Tschuggen Grand Hotel in Arosa, where he lives with his wife, Hannelore; the all-suite Carlton Hotel in St. Moritz; and the Hotel Eden Roc in Ascona, named hotel of the year in 2014 by the prestigious Gault&Millau ratings guide. His Hotel Valsana in Arosa, a four-star property, is undergoing a complete renovation through 2017. Kipp maintains high standards for his hotels -- commissioning luminaries like Mario Botta, a top Swiss-Italian architect who restored Milan's La Scala, to upgrade design elements including a wellness "temple" now famous in the Alps. Back in May 2002, Kipp gave his first interview in 15 years to the Swiss magazine Bilanz. When asked what he thought of Forbes's calculation of his wealth, he replied: "That's a worth question, anyone can come around and count for a couple of weeks. Seriously, it's not important any more whether you have one or four billion. What counts for me, is health and a happy family. And in particular, my wonderful wife, thanks to whose superb support everything was made possible." Kipp has one daughter, Ursula Bechtolsheimer, and several grandchildren; his son Ernst-Ludwig passed away in 2003.
