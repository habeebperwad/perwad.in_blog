			Meg Whitman has been reorganizing business tech firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where she became CEO when the company made its historic split from HP Inc. in November 2015. In the first half of 2016, Whitman merged the firm's enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corp. , sold its controlling stake in IT outsourcing firm Mphasis, and announced the departure of key executives. Whitman has said the moves will help HP Enterprise focus on data centers and cloud infrastructure amid growing competition in technology services. A former Hasbro and Walt Disney executive, Whitman is still best known for leading online auction site eBay from $5.7 million in revenues in 1997 to $8 billion at the time of her departure in 2008; eBay shares are also the biggest source of her fortune. Whitman, a Republican who ran for governor in California, called Donald Trump "a dishonest demagogue" during his presidential campaign and announced she was backing Hillary Clinton. After his election, she urged her employees to "give him the benefit of the doubt." Whitman joined Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on SurveyMonkey's board in September 2015 and is a board member at Procter & Gamble.
