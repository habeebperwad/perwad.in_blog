			Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google's parent Alphabet, has spoken about technologies he thinks will change the world in the next five to ten years, including self-driving cars (a Google project), 3-D printed buildings, fake meat, virtual reality and machine learning in education.  Schmidt essentially functions as Google's global ambassador, and has toured some of the world's most tightly controlled regimes to promote open Internet access, including Cuba and North Korea. The vast majority of Schmidt's wealth lies in Alphabet stock. In May 2015, his family's investment vehicle bought a 20% stake in hedge fund firm D.E. Shaw & Co. for an undisclosed price. Schmidt is also founding partner at venture capital firm Innovation Endeavors, with offices in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, which invested in tech startups including Uber and helicopter booking service Blade. Schmidt was Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011; prior to that he had stints as CEO of Novell and chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems. In February 2015, his family foundation gave $10 million to the Monterey Bay Aquarium to promote sustainable seafood consumption.
