			The patriarch of cable news, media-mogul-turned-land-baron Ted Turner grew his father's advertising firm into Turner Broadcasting and founded CNN in 1980. He sold Turner to Time Warner for $7.3 billion in stock in 1996 and, after Time Warner bought AOL in 2001, saw his fortune tumble as shares dropped.  He is America's second-largest individual landowner, with roughly 2 million acres in the U.S. plus additional property in Argentina and the world's largest private bison herd. Born in Cincinnati, Turner attended Brown University and served in the Coast Guard before joining his father's Turner Advertising. He took control in 1963 after his father committed suicide, and constructed a media empire that grew to include CNN, Cartoon Network and TNT. An avid sailor, he won the America's Cup in 1977.
