			Medical doctor Ranjan Pai's Manipal Group, an education and healthcare empire, has 6 colleges, including 4 overseas, in Malaysia, Antigua, Dubai and Nepal, as well as 16 hospitals with 2 more in the pipeline in Delhi.  His grandfather started the business when he opened India's first privately owned medical school in Manipal, a town in Karnataka state, in 1953. His father took charge after an acrimonious family split in 1978. Pai quit his job in the U.S. at age 28 and returned to join the business. He recently floated Neev, a real estate investment fund, with 4 partners, to invest in small property developers in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Other recent investments include finance firm InCred, which offers education loans, mortgages and loans to small enterprises. Pai has backed Saha, a venture capital fund for women entrepreneurs, and Stayology, a marketplace for accommodation.
