			Despite a decline in sales and net profits in a recent quarter amid India's sluggish property market, property baron Kushal Pal Singh's DLF saw its shares rise on his plans to sell his 40% stake in valuable rental arm DLF Cyber City Developers to institutional investors and use part of the proceeds to pare down DLF's $3.6 billion debt.  Blackstone Group and GIC of Singapore are believed to be among the favoured bidders. Last year DLF opened its 2-million square-foot Mall of India near Delhi. Singh's daughter has reportedly bought a bungalow for $65 million in Delhi's posh Lutyen's area. Singh left an army posting in 1961 to join DLF, a company started  by his father-in-law in 1946.
