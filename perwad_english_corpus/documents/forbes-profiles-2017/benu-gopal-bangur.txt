			Patriarch Benu Gopal Bangur enjoyed a 50% boost to his wealth on soaring shares of his Shree Cement, among India's top cement producers. The company benefited from a surge in sales and lower energy costs due to a fall in coal prices.  Son Hari Mohan, a chemical engineer, and grandson Prashant, a B-school grad, who together run Shree, have earmarked $330 million for capacity expansion. Bangur was born into a leading business family in Kolkata with interests in jute, paper, cement and power. He inherited an unprofitable cement outfit after a split in the family conglomerate in 1992 and went on to turn it around.
