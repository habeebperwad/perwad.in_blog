			Gail Miller and her husband, Larry, bought their first Toyota dealership in Utah in 1979. Now their business is ranked as one of the ten largest auto dealerships in the country, taking in an estimated $4.4 billion in 2016 revenue.  In addition to 60 car lots, the Larry H. Miller Group also owns 17 movie theaters and the NBA's Utah Jazz. The couple paid $22 million for the team in 1986; it's now worth $910 million. Before Larry died in 2009 he ran the day-to-day operations, but Gail weighed in on all major decisions. Upon his death she assumed 100% ownership of the businesses and serves as chairman. She also chairs the board of Salt Lake Community College.
