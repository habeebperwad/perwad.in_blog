			In November 2016, West Virginians elected the state's only billionaire, Jim Justice, to be their new governor. Justice, who switched his party affiliation in 2015 from Republican to Democrat, beat Republican candidate Bill Cole by running on a platform focused on education and improving tourism.  He capitalized on the popularity he gained in the state after rescuing the historic Greenbrier Resort from bankruptcy, giving it a $250 million facelift, transforming it into a 10,000 acre complex with a PGA-quality golf course and an underground casino. Justice, who inherited a coal business from his dad, still owns coal mines in five states. In the months leading up to the November 2016 election, he announced he would reopen four mines in West Virginia and re-employ hundreds of miners.
