Seeing an opportunity in real estate back home, he started Sobha Developers in 1995, in Bangalore.  Today that company is run by his son Ravi, an engineer from Purdue University. Menon, who lives in Dubai, is focused on expanding his Sobha Group's Middle East operations, which span the UAE, Qatar, Oman and other Gulf countries. Sobha has a joint venture with the government of Umm al-Quwain to develop the UAE's least-known emirate into a tourist hot spot. The proposed $6.8 billion island development will comprise seafront villas, hotels, wellness resorts, boutique stores and an 18-hole golf course. Sobha is also building 2 projects totaling $13 billion in Dubai. He and his wife, Sobha, after whom the group is named, have signed the Giving Pledge.
