			Carl Heinrich Hellmann founded the predecessor to Hellmann Worldwide Logistics in 1871 as a one-man business delivering goods by horse-drawn cart, in and around the town of Osnabrueck in northern Germany.  Four generations later, it's the world's 16th-largest logistics company, providing air, ocean and road freight via an extensive network spanning 157 countries. With the annual revenue of around $3.2 billion, the company employs more than 12,500 people and maintains 244 offices in 56 countries. In 1968, the company's shares were transferred to Carl's great-grandsons, Jost and Klaus, who are cousins; each owns 50% of the company. Jost Hellmann serves as the company's co-chief executive officer and co-managing director. According to media reports, Klaus and Jost Hellmann have fallen out against the background of a high debt burden the company is facing. Jost divides his time between Hamburg and Hellman's U.S. base of operations in Miami, where his wife and children reside.
