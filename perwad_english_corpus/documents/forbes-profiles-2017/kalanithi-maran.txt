			The sun is shining again on media baron Kalanithi Maran's Sun TV Network, a regional television heavyweight founded by him in 1993. Sun's array of 33 channels in four Indian languages reaches 95 million households in India as well as the south Indian diaspora in 27 countries around the world.  The broadcaster's shares more than doubled in the past year, boosting his wealth by $1.6 billion. Maran and his politician brother Dayanidhi, a former telecom minister, got a reprieve when a court recently dismissed all charges against them in a long-standing telecom corruption case.
