			eon Black, cofounder of private equity giant Apollo Global Management, has been cashing in on hefty dividends of more than $800 million since the firm went public in 2011. Just before Black graduated Harvard Business School, his father, who was CEO of United Brand Industries, died and left him $75,000 in life insurance.  He blew a big chunk of it trading commodities, teaching him a valuable lesson about doing his homework. His career really took off at Drexel Burnham Lambert, where he became the M&A chief. When Drexel folded in scandal, he partnered with two younger Drexel alums, Josh Harris and Marc Rowan, to start Apollo. True to his family background (his mom was an artist, his aunt owned an art gallery), he has an immense art collection estimated to be worth $2 billion. He and his wife, Debra, a melanoma survivor, have given millions to the Melanoma Research Alliance.
