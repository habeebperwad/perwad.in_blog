			The son of a Greek Cypriot shipping magnate, Stelios Haji-Ioannou earned the bulk of his fortune from his stake in budget airline easyJet, which he founded in 1995; his siblings Clelia and Polys, both also billionaires, hold slightly smaller stakes in the company.  Stelios has tried to replicate the easy magic, but other endeavors haven't been as fruitful. He floated easyHotel on the London Stock Exchange in 2014 with a disappointing public offering. In 2016 it started gaining some traction with an 8% increase in revenue from the previous year. Stelios maintains ownership of the easy brand through his private company, easyGroup, based in London. He licenses the brand for use in other sectors offering discounted value to customers, such as easyBus, easyCar and easyGym. Prior to founding easyJet, he started Stelmar shipping with money from his late father in 1992; it went public in 2001 and Stelios sold his stake in 2005 for quadruple the initial share price. His Stelios Philanthropic Foundation supports entrepreneurship and the environment. He was knighted in 2006 and now lives in Monaco, where he likes to take one of his two small yachts out on the water on weekends.
