			Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff owns around 5% of the cloud software firm he cofounded in 1999. He's helmed it since 2001. In June 2016, Salesforce announced its purchase of  Demandware, an e-commerce company, for $2.8 billion.  Benioff also owns 13% of fitness tracking company Fitbit, which went public in June 2015. Earlier in his career, he spent 13 years at database software giant Oracle as a protege of Larry Ellison. When Benioff tires of his two mansions in San Francisco, he escapes to a sprawling estate in Hawaii. He's an angel investor in dozens of tech startups and a prolific philanthropist.
