			Record sales of the iconic Royal Enfield motorbike kept shares of Indian two-wheeler tycoon Vikram Lal's Eicher Motors aloft. The company reported its highest ever revenues of $309 million in a recent quarter.  After launching its much-anticipated Himalayan adventure bike last year, it has begun selling it in Australia and Colombia. Royal Enfield opened its first U.S. store in Milwaukee in 2016, the home of rival Harley-Davidson, followed by its first Australian store in Melbourne. Son Siddhartha, who runs Eicher, is overseeing the company's global expansion from London. Vikram's father Man Mohan Lal founded a tractor shop called Goodearth Co. in 1948; a decade later he partnered with German firm Eicher, renaming the business Eicher Tractor.
