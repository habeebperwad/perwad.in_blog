			Hans Rausing's father founded packaging giant Tetra Laval in 1944. Hans and his brother Gad inherited the business in 1983, the year their father died. Rausing, who moved to the U.K. in the early 1980s to avoid punitive Swedish taxes, sold his share to Gad for an estimated $7 billion in 1995. The 6'8" tall, Russian speaker and collector of vintage cars now resides on a 900-acre estate in the village of Wadhurst in East Sussex where he breeds deer and wild boar.  He also owns land in New Zealand, homes in Barbados and London, and has an investment in Ecolean, a producer of environmentally friendly packaging material.  His Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project at the University of London supports research, training, and archiving of disappearing languages. He has also contributed to the British conservative party, while his daughter Sigrid donates to liberal and human rights groups. His daughter-in-law died of a drug overdose in 2012. His drug addict son, Hans-Kristian, hid her body in a bedroom for eight weeks. Hans-Kristian was released from rehab in fall 2013, and has since remarried.
