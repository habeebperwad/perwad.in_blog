The group was founded by their late father Ng Teng Fong, who moved from China to Singapore in 1934. Amid a sluggish home market, the brothers have been expanding overseas, notably in Australia, where they have invested close to $1.4 billion since 2013. Their latest purchase is a 65% stake in Vue Group, a restaurant chain started by celebrity chef Shannon Bennett.  Hong Kong arm, Sino Group, is overseen by older sibling Robert and his son Daryl while Philip oversees the Singapore interests.The brothers are staunch Christians and refer to Far East as a Christian enterprise.
