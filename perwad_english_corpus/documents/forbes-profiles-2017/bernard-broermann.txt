			Bernard Broermann founded his first hospital in 1984. Today, Asklepios Kliniken GmbH is one of the three largest operators of private hospitals in Germany and is increasingly active internationally as well.  The group, which employs more than 45,000 people, owns 150 hospitals worldwide and has been expanding its footprint through acquisitions and equity investments. It holds a 17.57% stake in rival Rhoen Klinikum AG and a majority stake in mediClin AG, a German operator of hospitals and clinics. Broermann -- who has an M.B.A. from Harvard University and practiced as an accountant and lawyer before founding Asklepios -- also is known in Germany for his interest in luxury hotels. In December 2014, Asklepios Kliniken GmbH and Dr. Broermann Hotels & Residences GmbH, an umbrella subsidiary for the group's hotel investments, announced the purchase of the five-star Hotel Atlantic Kempinski in Hamburg for an undisclosed sum. Other group properties include the Falkenstein Grand Kempinski in Koenigstein, a five-star luxury hotel and spa in the hilly Taunus region near Frankfurt, and the Villa Rothschild Kempinski, another luxury hotel also near Frankfurt. Broermann's expansion into hotels has proven to be a successful means of attracting more foreign patients to Asklepios' medical clinics, according to the group.
