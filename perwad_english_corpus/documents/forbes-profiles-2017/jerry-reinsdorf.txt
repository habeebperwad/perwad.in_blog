			Jerry Reinsdorf made a fortune in sports, buying the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox in the 1980s and watching his fortune skyrocket as the value of sports teams shot up over the next three decades. Reinsdorf and other investors bought a controlling stake in the Bulls for $9.2 million in 1985, one year after the team drafted Michael Jordan.  Six championships and 32 years later, the Bulls are worth $2.5 billion, and Reinsdorf owns an estimated 40% of the team. He also has an estimated 19% stake in the White Sox, valued at $185 million. A Brooklyn native, Reinsdorf went to George Washington University before moving to Chicago in 1957 to attend law school at Northwestern. He hasn't left The Windy City since. He made his first fortune in real estate, cofounding Balcor Company in 1973 and selling it nine years later to American Express.
