			Along with his siblings Luciano, Giuliana, and Carlo, Gilberto Benetton helped found the clothing retailer Benetton Group in 1965. Their father died when eldest sibling Luciano was just 14 years old. To help out his mother, Luciano started working at a clothing store in their hometown of Treviso, Italy.  A bright yellow sweater knitted by Giuliana caught the attention of Luciano's colleagues, leading them to found Benetton, which focused on bright colors and efficient production. Gradually the retailer expanded internationally, reaching Paris in 1969 and New York in 1980. It became known for its controversial and award-winning shock advertising campaigns in 1982, featuring mixed-race couples and the blood stained clothes in which a soldier died in the Yugoslavian conflict. Luciano turned over management to professionals after the group hit some turbulence in the late 1990s. In 2012, they took the company private; Luciano's son Alessandro took over as chairman until 2014. Through holding company Edizione, the family has invested in a variety of Italian businesses, the most valuable of which is highway concessionaire Atlantia S.p.A.
