			Austrian born Reinold Geiger heads up French cosmetics retailer L'Occitane, which brings the natural creams and perfumes of Provence to consumers around the world. Since he first invested in the company in 1994, Geiger has overseen the brand's global expansion to nearly 1,500 stores in 90 countries.  L'Occitane was the first French company to go public on the Hong Kong stock exchange when its shares debuted in 2010.  An ardent supporter of eye care to prevent blindness, he created the L'Occitane Foundation in 2006 with the goal of funding quality optometry services for 10 million people by 2020. Geiger owns a ski chalet in Meribel, spa hotel Les Couvent des Minime in Provence, a beach house on the Ile de Re in the Atlantic and a house in Trancoso, Brazil.
