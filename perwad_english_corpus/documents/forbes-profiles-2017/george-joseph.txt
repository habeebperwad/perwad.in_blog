			While working as a door-to-door insurance salesman in early 60s, George Joseph realized that auto-insurance companies weren't screening their customers correctly. After raising $2 million in capital, he started Mercury General which offered cut-rate deals to safer-than-average drivers.  Joseph, a former World War II flight navigator, still goes into the office regularly and serves as chairman of his $3 billion (2015 sales) publicly-traded insurer. Earlier this year, the company joined other insurance giants like Geico and Farmers in offering ride-sharing insurance to Uber and Lyft drivers in states such as California and Arizona.
