			In 1976, Mitchell Jacobson began working for MSC Direct, an office and industrial equipment distributor his father Sidney had founded back in 1941. . Shortly after Sidney founded the firm, he became concerned that just two customers made up 90% of his business, so he turned to catalog sales to expand the client base.   In 1995, Mitchell took over as CEO of the Melville, N.Y.-based firm, which distributes goods worldwide. He held the top job through 2005 and is now the largest shareholder of the company, which distributes hundreds of products, from staplers to air conditioners.
