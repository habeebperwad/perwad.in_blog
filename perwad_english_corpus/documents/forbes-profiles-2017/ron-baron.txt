			Buy-and-hold billionaire Ron Baron oversees investment strategy for $22 billion (assets) Baron Capital, which has more than 1 million investors. Among its long-term holdings: Under Armour, Tesla and Hyatt.  Baron, who spent summers working as lifeguard, teaching waterskiing and driving an ice cream truck, wanted to be a physician but didn't get into medical school. So he became a securities analyst in 1970 before opening his own firm. The Jersey native sold his New Jersey house to Bruce Springsteen at one point and now owns one of the biggest estates in the Hamptons, which he assembled from 2001 to 2009 for a total of $152 million.
