			Hubert Burda is a publishing baron who likes to mingle with movie stars, media personalities, fashionistas and captains of industry. A celebrity in his own right, he's married to well-known German actress Maria Furtwangler.  In 2010, he handed over day-to-day control of Hubert Burda Media to Paul-Bernhard Kallen, a former McKinsey & Company consultant and Burda chief financial officer, and has since transferred a 49.86% ownership stake to his two children, Jacob and Elisabeth. (He still owns the remaining 50.1%). Burda's portfolio now consists of 540 media products worldwide, including the German editions of Elle, InStyle and Playboy. Though built via mass-market print publications -- the German newsweekly Focus and the celebrity magazine Bunte are company mainstays -- digital sources now account for fully half of Burda's roughly $2.2 billion in annual revenue. A big success in both print and digital is BurdaStyle, a portfolio of media brands aimed at women. (BurdaStyle has been publishing Harper's Bazaar in Germany since August 2013, in a joint venture with U.S. media company Hearst.)  In March 2014, Burda entered into a joint venture with F+W, a New York City-based content and e-commerce company, to run the BurdaStyle brand in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the U.K. digital activities of BurdaStyle. Among Hubert Burda's philanthropic endeavors are the Felix Burda Foundation, which is committed to reducing the number of deaths from colon cancer in Germany (it's named after his son Felix, who died of colon cancer in 2001, at age 33). He also supports the Hermann-Lenz-Prize, a German literary award; the Burda Center for Innovative Communication, a media center at Ben Gurion University in Israel; and the Burda Academy of the Third Millennium, an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and thinkers.
