			Hamilton "Tony" James was recruited to Blackstone Group in 2002 to help founder Steve Schwarzman run the rapidly expanding private equity and asset management firm. He's helped build it into the largest buyout firm on earth, with $367 billion in assets under management.  James, the company's Chief Operating Officer, was long considered a potential successor to the company's founder and CEO, but Schwarzman has held onto the top spot. Now James reportedly has his eyes on a job in government. He earned his BA and MBA from Harvard in mid 1970s, then spent 25 years at investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. He served as chairman of investment banking and private equity at Credit Suisse First Boston before leaving to co-run Blackstone. He's a trustee for several environmental nonprofits, including the Wildlife Conservation Society, as well as a trustee for The Second Stage Theatre and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. A supporter of Hillary Clinton, in December 2015, James reportedly hosted a fundraiser for the presidential candidate at his Manhattan home; Warren Buffett was among the attendees.
