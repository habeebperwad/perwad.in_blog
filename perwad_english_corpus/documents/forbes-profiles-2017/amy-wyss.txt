			Amy Wyss worked for many years at Synthes, the medical equipment firm founded by her father, Hansjoerg Wyss. He sold it to Johnson & Johnson in 2012 for $20.2 billion in cash and stock, and she got a slice of that.  In 2014, a U.S. Senate investigation into offshore tax evasion -- which did not implicate the Wyss family -- revealed emails from Hansjoerg Wyss' private bankers at Credit Suisse bickering over custody of his Synthes' sale proceeds. The emails also revealed that Amy owned a fortune of $1.8 billion. A philanthropist, she established the LOR Foundation in 2007, which funds projects aimed at enhancing livability for rural communities in the Intermountain West of the U.S. The Skidmore College graduate also served on the board of the National Outdoor Leadership School and led its endowment initiative.
