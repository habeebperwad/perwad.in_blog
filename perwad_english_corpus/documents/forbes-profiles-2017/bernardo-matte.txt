			Bernardo Matte Larrain and his two billionaire siblings (Patricia Matte and Eliodoro Matte, each with their own billion-dollar fortunes) inherited what is today Chile's largest pulp and paper producer, Empresas CMPC, from their father, Eliodoro Matte Ossa.  They also own stakes in telecom, banking and shipping firms. Bernardo oversees the family's other assets, including its stake in financial firm Bicecorp, of which he is president, and electric utility Colbun. In 2014, Bernardo left his position on the board of Colbun to focus on CMPC and Entel, a telecommunications company in which he and his family also have a stake.
