			One of four cofounders of SAP, Hans-Werner Hector built up the North American market for the German software giant and then left the firm in 1997, after a falling out with his partners. The rift occurred after he transferred to a Jersey Islands trust SAP shares representing more than 10% of the company's voting rights.  Hector wanted to diversify his portfolio for tax and money-management purposes, so in 1996, the trustee, Union Bank of Switzerland, began selling the shares to institutional investors. This was said to open the door to the possibility of an investor obtaining a blocking minority that could threaten the founding shareholders' control over the company. Hector, his wife Josephine and their charitable foundation, H.W. & J. Hector Stiftung, were the sole beneficiaries of the trust. In 2003, Hector, who graduated with a degree in Mathematics from the University of Saarland, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Karlsruhe in recognition of his support of highly talented pupils. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), as it is now known, is renowned for its engineering expertise and counts among its alumni Hector's fellow SAP co-founders. The Hector School of Engineering and Management was founded in 2005 as a graduate school under the umbrella of KIT. In 2008, Hector established the Hector Science Fund at KIT in the amount of 200 million euros (about $290 million at exchange rates prevailing at the time). Hector and Josephine also support medical research, social projects and art patronage. In 2011, they donated more than $60 million to the German city of Mannheim to renovate its museum.
