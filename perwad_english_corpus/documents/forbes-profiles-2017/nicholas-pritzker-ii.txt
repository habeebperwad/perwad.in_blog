			Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker has shifted his attention and investment dollars to causes like clean energy, marijuana legalization and criminal justice reform. Pritzker's Clean Energy Trust, which he cofounded and cochairs, pledged $10 million to start-ups focused on the issue at the 2015 White House Clean Energy Investment Summit.  In the 2016 election, Pritzker teamed up with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and philanthropist and DFS cofounder Chuck Feeney in an effort to repeal the death penalty in California (voters did not approve the measure). Pritzker spent many years leading Hyatt's new hotel development efforts; he still owns about 1% of Hyatt stock.
