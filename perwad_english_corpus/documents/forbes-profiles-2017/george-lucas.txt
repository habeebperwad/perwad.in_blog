			George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012 for some $4 billion and now has little to do with the franchise. Too bad for him: Its latest installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which pulled in $2.1 billion worldwide, was the top-grossing film of 2015 and third highest of all time.  Since the sale he has largely retired from filmmaking. He became a father for the fourth time in 2013 at age 69, and has now turned his gaze to philanthropy: His charitable family foundation is already endowed with $1 billion. Lucas, whose parents ran a stationery store, attended junior college in Modesto, Calif. before moving to the University of Southern California (USC), where his filmmaking skills caught Hollywood's eye and landed him a plum position as a production assistant on Francis Ford Coppola's 'Finian's Rainbow.' He worked his way up and founded Lucasfilm, his production company, in 1971. Lucas built his fortune thanks to a knack for securing toy rights to movies and an eye for vertical integration: when Lucas needed special effects for 'Star Wars,' he started his own special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, in 1975. A keen art collector, he recently announced plans to build the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Exposition Park, Los Angeles.
