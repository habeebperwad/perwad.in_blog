			Melker Schörling lay the foundation for his wealth by negotiating with fellow billionaire Gustaf Douglas to get a stake in troubled security-giant Securitas in return to accepting the CEO role in 1987. A little more than a decade later, he set up Melker Schörling AB as a holding company for his investments.  Now publicly traded, Melker Schörling AB holds stakes in precision-measuring tool maker Hexagon and lock manufacturer Assa Abloy and counts H&M billionaires Stefan Persson and his sister Lottie as shareholders. Stefan is also a longtime board member, as is both his daughter Sofia and Märta. Schörling announced he would leave his chairman post in 2017, citing health issues.
