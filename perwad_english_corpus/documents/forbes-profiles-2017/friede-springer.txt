			Friede Springer is heiress of the media company Axel Springer Verlag, founded by her husband, Axel. Friede was the fifth wife of Axel. They met when she was hired as a nanny to his two sons, and were married in 1978. Axel, who was 30 years older, apparently groomed her to take on responsibilities at the company.  Upon his death in 1985, she assumed control of a juggernaut that currently publishes newspapers in 44 countries, including the leading German conservative daily, Die Welt, and Germany's largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung. Propelled in part by its acquisition of the TV news station N24, finalized in 2014, Axel Springer aims to build the leading multimedia news outlet for quality journalism in the German-speaking world. Meanwhile, it generates nearly half its $3.5 billion in revenue from international markets, with digital activities accounting for more than 60% of the total. The company publishes the foreign-language editions of Forbes magazine in Poland and Russia. In 2015, it paid roughly $343 million for 88% of Business Insider, and subsequently raised its its stake in the New York-based digital business news outlet to 97%. It's an investor in social video news publisher NowThis Media, a New York-start-up targeting 18- to 34-year-olds with short videos about trending stories for mobile devices and distribution across social networks. Friede Springer is active in various philanthropic organizations, and has received numerous awards for her efforts to rebuild German-Jewish relations. She also holds the Federal Cross of Merit for her efforts to promote social, cultural and scientific dialogue worldwide. A member of Germany's conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union, she is a personal friend of chancellor Angela Merkel.
