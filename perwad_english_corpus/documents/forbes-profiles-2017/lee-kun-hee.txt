			Lee Kun-Hee is chairman of Korea's largest conglomerate, Samsung Group, which encompasses everything from textiles, IT services and specialty materials to insurance, leisure businesses, consumer electronics and engineering and construction.  In May 2014, he suffered a heart attack and remains hospitalized. Since then, virtually no concrete information has emerged about his condition. Meanwhile in February 2017, his only son and heir to the sprawling Samsung empire, Jay Y. Lee, was arrested, indicted and jailed on bribery charges. He is accused of paying around $38 million to a long time confidante of impeached President Park Geun-Hye to secure a controversial merger, which prosecutors say was key  to consolidate control of the country's largest conglomerate. Jay Y. Lee denied the charges. Lee's first daughter, Lee Boo-Jin, is CEO of Samsung Group's hospitality company, Hotel Shilla, which includes a growing chain of duty-free shops. His second daughter, Lee Seo-Hyun, heads C&T's fashion division.
