			Susanne Klatten ranks as Germany's richest woman thanks primarily to the interests she inherited in automaker BMW from her deceased parents, Herbert and Johanna Quandt. Susanne and her brother, Stefan Quandt, together own almost 50% of BMW.  A trained economist with an M.B.A., Klatten is credited with helping transform Altana AG, based in the German town of Wesel on the Lower Rhine, into a world-class pharmaceutical/specialty chemical corporation. She inherited 50% of the company, which has been a phenomenal moneymaker and currently derives about 85% of its $2 billion-plus in annual sales from foreign customers. After it sold its pharmaceutical business, best known for the blockbuster ulcer drug Pantoprazol, to Scandinavian firm Nycomed for around $6 billion in 2006, she received roughly half of the proceeds in the form of a special dividend. Having since taken the company private, she currently owns 100% and serves as co-Deputy Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. She also holds stakes in wind power outfit Nordex AG, soil additive company Geohumus and carbon and graphite producer SGL Group, where she became Chairperson of the Supervisory Board in 2013. Her SKion Holding Group, an investment vehicle based in Bad Homburg vor der Hoehe near Frankfurt am Main, has an arm dedicated to water technology, with stakes in five companies in Germany and the Netherlands. Klatten lives in Bad Homburg vor der Hoehe and has a second home in Kitzbuehel, Austria; she is sometimes spotted at the Alpine ski resort in winter months with her husband Jan at her side. Klatten is otherwise known for keeping an extremely low profile.
