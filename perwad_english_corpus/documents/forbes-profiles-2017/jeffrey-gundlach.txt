			Bond-trader extraordinaire Jeffrey Gundlach spent decades helping Los Angeles' TCW build its fixed-income business only to be kicked out in 2009. That prompted him to start cross-town rival DoubleLine Capital with 40 other former employees, amidst a barrage of sordid allegations and lawsuits.  With financial backing from earlier TCW refugees Howard Marks and Bruce Karch of Oaktree Capital, DoubleLine has become the fastest-growing mutual fund start-up in history and now has over $100 billion under management. Buffalo native Gundlach studied math and philosophy at Dartmouth and then Yale, but gave up the pursuit of a doctorate in 1985 to be the drummer in a punk rock band and then answered a classified ad to get into investments. Gundlach is known for his arrogance and bold calls--having correctly predicted the housing crash in 2007 and the decline of interest rates in 2013 and 2014. He is passionate about modern art with an extensive collection of works by artists including Warhol, Mondrian and Rauschenberg.
