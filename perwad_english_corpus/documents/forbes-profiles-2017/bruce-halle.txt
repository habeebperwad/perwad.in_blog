			Discount Tire founder Bruce Halle started with just six tires in a showroom in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1960. Now his company has more than 900 stores in 31 states and estimated revenues of $4.2 billion. Halle grew up in a Catholic home with 7 siblings during the Great Depression.  He delivered newspapers, cut grass and even dug graves to support his family. After serving in the Marines during the Korean war, Halle got a degree in business administration from East Michigan University. Today his Bruce T. Halle Scholarship program allows every child of a Discount Tire employee the opportunity to attend college. Halle and his wife, Diane, were awarded the title "Dame and Knight Commander of the Pontifical Order of Saint Gregory the Great" by Pope Benedict XVI for supporting the restoration of the Pope's private chapel, the Pauline Chapel.
