			Ken Fisher founded his money management firm, Fisher Investments, in 1979 with approximately $250. Its assets under management have been steadily climbing, up $20 billion in the past five years, to $65 billion.  A longtime columnist for Forbes Magazine, he has published 11 books including "Plan Your Prosperity and "How To Smell A Rat: The Five Signs Of Financial Fraud." His father, Philip, wrote the well-known investment book "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits." Considered an expert on 19th century logging, Fisher has documented more than 35 abandoned logging camps in the northern Santa Cruz Mountains. He also endowed the Kenneth L. Fisher Chair in Redwood Forest Ecology at Humboldt State University, apparently the first time a chair was devoted to a single species of tree.
