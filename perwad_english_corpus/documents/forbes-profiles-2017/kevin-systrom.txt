			From a photo app to Facebook. Kevin Systrom launched photo-sharing app Instagram in 2010 and Facebook agreed to buy it for $1 billion in stock and cash in 2012. Systrom owned 40% of Instagram going into the deal, and got mostly Facebook stock, which has skyrocketed in value since then.  Both Systrom and his cofounder and Chief Technology Officer Mike Krieger, a fellow Stanford alum, have stayed on at the company. Under Systrom as CEO, Instagram has become one of the fastest growing apps of all time, with 600 million monthly users as of December 2016. Its nascent advertising business is expected to generate $5 billion in sales by 2018, according to eMarketer. FORBES estimates Instagram could be worth up to $50 billion if it were broken out from Facebook. Systrom has lured well known public figures onto the platform, from Pope Francis to singer Selena Gomez. Known for wearing stylish suits, Systrom is a regular at fashion and cultural events, from the Met Gala to the Oscars.
