			Philip and Cristina Green are perhaps the most vilified billionaires in Britain for their role in letting their home retailer, BHS, collapse, which put pensions for 19,000 British workers at risk. A 2016 Parliament report called him the "unacceptable face  of capitalism. " Parliament voted unanimously in October to strip him of his knighthood, the first time it had ever conducted such a vote. In late February, Green agreed to pay about $450 million to cover the pension deficit. The couple still owns Topshop and Topman, as well as Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge along with others. In 2012, they sold 25% of Topshop to J. Crew investor Leonard Green & Partners for $763 million. A college drop-out, Philip started his first business at age 21 importing jeans from Asia with a $30,000 loan from his family. Cristina reportedly started her first clothing store in South Africa with her first husband, Robert, before meeting Green and building their businesses together. Today, Phillip, as chairman, works in London during the week and travels to Monoco, where Cristina lives, on the weekends.
