			Bang Jun-Hyuk is the chairman of South Korea's largest mobile gaming company, Netmarble, which he founded in 2000. Starting with just $88,000 pooled from early investors, Bang has built Netmarble into a $1.2 billion (2016 sales) gaming empire, primarily known for its action-packed role-playing games that have become hits across Asia, U. K and the U.S. He's now poised to take his company public in Seoul in May 2017 and plans to use the raised capital toward new M&A opportunities, particularly in the U.S. A high school dropout, he is an outlier among the country's richest tech entrepreneurs who typically boast pedigrees from elite universities.
