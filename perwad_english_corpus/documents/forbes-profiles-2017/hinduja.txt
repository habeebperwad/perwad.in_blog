			Four close-knit siblings, Srichand, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok, control the Hinduja Group, a far-flung multinational empire with businesses ranging from trucks and lubricants to banking and cable television.  The group was started by their father, Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja, who initially traded goods in the Sindh region of India (now Pakistan) then moved to Iran in 1919, where the group was headquartered until his sons moved the base to London in 1979. The brothers own valuable real estate in London, including their home Carlton House Terrace and the historic Old War Office building in Whitehall. Srichand and Gopichand live in London and Prakash resides in Geneva. Youngest sibling Ashok oversees their Indian interests from Mumbai.
