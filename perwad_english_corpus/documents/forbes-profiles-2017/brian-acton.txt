			Five years after Facebook rejected his job application, computer engineer Brian Acton sold WhatsApp to the social media giant in 2014 for $22 billion in cash and stock. Acton received about $3 billion for his stake in WhatsApp, which he cofounded with fellow programmer Jan Koum.  Acton's mother ran a freight-shipping firm and gave him early insight into running a business and meeting payroll. After Acton and Koum left Yahoo in 2007, Acton became WhatsApp's first investor; Koum invited him to be his cofounder in late 2009. WhatsApp is now tied with Facebook messenger as the biggest mobile messaging service in the world, with more than 1 billion active users, the vast majority of whom are outside the U.S. The app, available in more than 180 countries, is used to make over 100 million calls a day. Koum has a note signed and written by Acton saying "No ads! No games! No gimmicks!" taped to his desk as a reminder to keep WhatsApp a pure communications service and nothing more.
