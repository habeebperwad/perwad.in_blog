			The son of a grocer, Ron Burkle started working as a box boy at age 13. He formed investment firm Yucaipa in 1986 and bagged big returns by buying and selling supermarket chains Fred Meyer, Jurgensen's, Ralphs and others.  Although he primarily backs private companies that support the food trade in areas like logistics, cold storage and food safety, Burkle has put money into technology ventures including Airbnb and Foursquare. He also invested in Hollywood movie production firm Relativity Media, which declared bankruptcy in June 2015.
