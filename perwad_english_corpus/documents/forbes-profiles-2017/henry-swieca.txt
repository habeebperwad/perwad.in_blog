			The Wall Street veteran manages his personal fortune through Talpion Fund Management, the firm he opened in 2010 shortly after selling his stake in hedge fund firm Highbridge Capital Management to JPMorgan Chase.  Talpion's portfolio includes real estate and startup cash for new money management firms. Swieca co-founded Highbridge Capital in 1992 with childhood friend Glenn Dubin; the duo named the firm after an aqueduct that connected New York City's Washington Heights (where Swieca was raised) and the Bronx. Son of Polish holocaust survivors, Swieca lost both of his parents at 19 and turned to investing in stocks to fund his education. He donates generously to Jewish causes, and sits on the Board of Overseers at Columbia Business School, where he earned an M.B.A. in 1982.
