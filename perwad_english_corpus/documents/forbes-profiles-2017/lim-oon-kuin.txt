			Fujian-born Lim Oon Kuin, known as O.K. Lim, founded Hin Leong Trading in 1963 at age 20 with a single truck delivering diesel to fishermen and small rural power producers. He built Hin Leong, which means "prosperity" in Chinese, into one of Singapore's largest independent oil traders.  The group's shipping arm, Ocean Tankers, owns a fleet of more than 130 tankers and is run by son Evan. Assets include oil storage unit Universal Terminals, which it co-owns with PetroChina.
