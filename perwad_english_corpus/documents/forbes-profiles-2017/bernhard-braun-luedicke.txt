			Bernhard Braun-Luedicke is the son of Barbara Braun-Luedicke, a member of the Supervisory Board of B. Braun Melsungen AG. Barbara's cousin Ludwig Georg Braun took over B. Braun in 1977 -- when the company had just $24 million in annual sales -- and turned it into one of the world's largest manufacturers of medical products.   Employing some 54,000 people globally and generating around $6.5 billion in annual revenue, the company has four divisions: Hospital Care, whose products include infusion and injection solutions; Aesculap, a manufacturer of surgical instruments and devices; OPM (outpatient market), which sells medical products to practitioners outside of the hospital market; and Avitum, a provider of dialysis and other technologies relating to blood treatment. Bernhard owns 11.7% of the company.
