			Terry Pegula turned his fracking fortune into a Buffalo sports empire. After his oil and gas outfit, East Resources, sold the bulk of its assets to Royal Dutch Shell for $4.7 billion in 2010, he spent $189 million the next year buying the NHL's Buffalo Sabres.  In 2014 he outbid groups led by Donald Trump and Jon Bon Jovi to pick up the Bills for $1.4 billion. With his wife, Kim, he spent some $220 million to create HarborCenter, an entertainment complex next to the Sabres' arena that features 2 ice rinks, a hotel and a restaurant. A former math major, Pegula switched to petroleum engineering on a scholarship and joined Getty Oil after graduation. He founded East Resources in 1983 with a $7,500 loan from friends and family to drill sand wells, and still retains oil and gas interests in places like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Colorado. His daughter, Jessica Pegula, is a professional tennis player.
