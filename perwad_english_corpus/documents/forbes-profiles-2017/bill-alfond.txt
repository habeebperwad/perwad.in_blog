			Bill Alfond's father traded Warren Buffett his Dexter Shoe Company in exchange for a chunk of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1993, and the Alfonds have made a fortune from the rising value of those shares. Harold Alfond, a onetime factory worker who never went to college, bought an old shoe factory, started the Norrwock Shoe Company and sold it for $1 million in 1944. Fourteen years later he snatched up an old mill in Dexter, Maine and turned it into the Dexter Shoe Company, which eventually sold millions of boots and causal shoes a year.  After trading the company to Buffett in 1993 he focused on philanthropy, donating millions to universities and hospitals across Maine before he died in 2007. Son Bill is one of four siblings who share the fortune; all are billionaires. The family owns a small stake in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool FC plus stakes in Roush Fenway Racing and New England Sports Network.
