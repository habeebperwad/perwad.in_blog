			Sumet Jiaravanon is the older brother of Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont and executive chairman of Charoen Pokphand Group, the family's sprawling conglomerate. He also chairs the family's Chinese arm Chia Tai Group.  Sumet is listed separately from Dhanin based on his ownership of close to a 13% stake in the family's vast assets. His wealth is up partly on new information about the family's private holdings.
