			The quantitative trading genius behind Renaissance Technologies retired from his hedge fund firm in 2010, but he still plays a role at Renaissance and continues to benefit from its strong performance. The firm's biggest fund, Renaissance Institutional Equities, was up 21.5% net of fees in 2016. Investors have been rushing into Renaissance and the firm now manages some $36 billion.  The firm has received more public attention recently because of co-CEO Robert Mercer's support of President Donald Trump. Simons has traditionally supported Democratic candidates and backed Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. The MIT grad was a codebreaker for the U.S. during the Vietnam War. In 1982 he founded Renaissance, using computer modeling to find inefficiencies in highly liquid securities. Simons has given away $2.1 billion to charity, chairs Math for America, and supports autism research.
