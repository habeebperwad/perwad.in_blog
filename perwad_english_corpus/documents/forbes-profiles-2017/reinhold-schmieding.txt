Roughly a decade later the Michigan native relocated the headquarters to Naples, Fla. ; the privately held company has since developed over 9,500 products used in shoulder, hip and other joint surgeries. The notoriously press-shy founder is still named as a co-inventor on several patents every year. He owns an estimated 95% of the business.
