			James Cox Chambers and his siblings, Margaretta Taylor and Katharine Rayner, are heirs to the Cox family fortune. Their grandfather, James M. Cox, founded what has become Cox Enterprises, an automotive and media conglomerate.  They split a 50% stake in the business, which they received from their 96-year-old mother, Anne Cox Chambers, in an asset shuffling that became public in 2015. Neither Anne nor her children have ever had an active role at the firm, which includes such brands as Autotrader.com and publications like The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The company is still entirely owned by the Cox family. James' cousin, fellow billionaire Jim Kennedy, is its chairman. James is a Bard College trustee and alum, an amateur filmmaker and owner of an organic farm in the Hudson Valley.
