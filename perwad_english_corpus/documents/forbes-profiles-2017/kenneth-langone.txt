			Investment banker Kenneth Langone was an early investor in Home Depot in 1978 with cofounders Arthur Blank and Bernard Marcus (now also billionaires) and as a result is referred to as a cofounder of the home improvement chain.  He still has a stake in Home Depot, but now invests in tech companies and industrial giants. After digging ditches for the Long Island Expressway as a teenager, Langone went to Bucknell and graduated with a degree in economics. He served in the U.S. Army for two years before heading to Wall Street. Langone made a name for himself taking Ross Perot Sr.'s Electronic Data Systems public in 1968. Langone gave $10 million to NYU's part time MBA program in 1999 and $200 million to its medical center in 2008. Both are now named after him.
