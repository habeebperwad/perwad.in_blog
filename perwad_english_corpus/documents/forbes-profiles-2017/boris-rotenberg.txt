			Boris Rotenberg and his older brother, Arkady, are the billionaires and co-owners of SMP Bank. The Rotenberg brothers were hit by U.S. sanctions and had assets frozen in 2014 because of their close ties to Putin.   The U.S. Treasury Department claimed that Putin had awarded the Rotenbergs billions of dollars in contracts with oil and gas giant Gazprom and for the Sochi Winter Olympics. Boris, unlike Arkady, was not subject to European Union sanctions because he has Finnish citizenship. Boris is vice president of the Russian Judo Federation. He sponsors the SMP Racing Project, which supports young Russian drivers. Boris's son Roman is vice-president of Russian Ice Hockey Federation and vice-president KHL's club SKA Saint Petersburg.
