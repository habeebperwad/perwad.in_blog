			Outspoken investor with a Midas touch, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is often referred to as India's Warren Buffett. Son of an income tax officer, he started dabbling in stocks while in college. Rather than take a job, he plunged into investing, starting with $100 in 1985 when the Bombay Stock Exchange Index was at 150; it is now over 29,000. His privately owned stock trading firm Rare Enterprises, derives its name from the first two initials of his name and wife Rekha's name.  Fond of cigars and whiskey, he calls himself an old-fashioned investor and is known to shun startups with high valuations but no profits.
