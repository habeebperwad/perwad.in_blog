			Johannes Kaercher owns 50% of the world's largest privately held cleaning equipment company, Alfred Kaercher GmbH & Co. KG. The business was founded in 1935 by his father, Alfred Kaercher, when he started developing product ideas in the field of heating technology.  Among its early offerings: a furnace for tempering steel and hardening light alloys, airplane cabin heaters and pre-heating burners for airplane motors. In 1950, Kaercher created the first European hot-water pressure washer. Kaercher died in 1959, at age 58, leaving the company in the hands of his wife Irene, who successfully built on a legacy of innovation for over three decades before transferring ownership to her children, Johannes and Susanne. Today, the company manufactures cleaning products and equipment for homes, gardens, transport, buildings and other professional applications. It employs more than 11,000 people around the globe and generates around $2.3 billion in revenue. Neither Johannes nor his sister is active in the operational management of the company.
