			For Maurice Alter, shopping mall redevelopments and expansions, plus surging prices down Australia's east coast, underpin the value of his Melbourne-based Pacific Group. The business, including a development and construction arm, epc. Pacific, is run by son Sam Alter. After immigrating to Australia from Poland, Alter bought his first property in the 1950s and established Pacific Shopping Centres in 1979.
