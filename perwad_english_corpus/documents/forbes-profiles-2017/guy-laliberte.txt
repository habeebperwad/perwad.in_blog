			Guy Laliberte cofounded Cirque du Soleil, one of the biggest live entertainment groups in the world. Known for its intricate circus shows, the Cirque has performed for more than 160 million spectators across more than 400 cities on six continents.  Laliberte started out as a street performer in Quebec, walking on stilts and breathing fire. He founded Cirque du Soleil in 1984 when the Canadian government awarded him a $1 million contract to develop a celebration for the 450th anniversary of the discovery of Canada. In 2015 he sold much of his 90% stake to U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital and Chinese investment group Fosun. Laliberte kept 10% of the company. He traveled to space as a tourist in 2009.
