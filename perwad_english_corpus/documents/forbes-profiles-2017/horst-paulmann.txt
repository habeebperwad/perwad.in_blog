			Paulmann founded Cencosud, one of the largest retail conglomerates in Latin America, with a total of 140,000 employees and operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Colombia. As a teenager, Paulmann moved from his native Germany to Chile after World War II and opened his first supermarket in 1976. In addition to Cencosud's 944 supermarkets, the company manages 53 shopping centers, including Costanera Center in Chile -- South America's largest mall.  In January 2016 Chilean regulators accused Cencosud, Walmart Chile and Chilean supermarket chain Unimarc of fixing the price of fresh chicken between 2008 and 2011. Cencosud faces a potential fine of $23 million. Cencosud issued a statement denying the allegations.
