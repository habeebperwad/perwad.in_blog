			Chang has built a network of education and training centers in bucolic settings throughout Korea to provide training programs to some 43,000 Kyowon staff members. In 2015 it celebrated its 30th anniversary after branching out into everything from e-books to tutoring.  While Kyowon moves into developing educational content for middle and high school students as well as pre-schoolers, 
Chang is expanding his domain to include educational travel programs and leisure activities, as well as hotels, health food and "lifestyle" products, including water purifiers and Oriental herb-based cosmetics.
