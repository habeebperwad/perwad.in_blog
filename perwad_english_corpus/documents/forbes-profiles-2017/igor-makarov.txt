			Igor Makarov is the founder of Itera, the first independent Russian gas company. In the late 1990s, it was Russia's main exporter of gas from Turkmenistan, where Makarov was born. For a time, he capitalized on his connections to high-ranking officials at the Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom, acquiring Gazprom assets,  including big gas fields, for next to nothing.  But after Vladimir Putin shook up the gas giant's leadership in 2001, Itera nearly lost its business. Makarov managed to save the company by turning over some assets to Gazprom. In 2012 Itera entered into a joint venture with Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company; the next year, Rosneft bought out Itera for $2.9 billion. Makarov is the president of the Russian Cycling Federation and was once a member of the USSR cycling team.
