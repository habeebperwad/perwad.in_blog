					Ownership split in 1961: Karl Sr. obtained stores in southern Germany, plus the rights to the Aldi brand in the U.K., Australia and the U.S., while Theo Sr. took the stores in northern Germany and the rest of Europe
				
				
					Theo Sr. bought U.S. grocery chain Trader Joe's in 1971
				
				
					Family foundation, the Siepmann Stiftung (formed in 1973 using the maiden name of Karl and Theo's mother), is believed to own at last 75% of Aldi Sued, with the rest owned by charitable foundations that support cardiovascular research as well as cultural and other projects
				
				
					Beate Heister has never worked at Aldi Sued but sits, together with her husband Peter and her son Peter Max Heister (one of six children), on its advisory board
				
				
					Karl Jr., who has no children, has worked in different positions at the company but withdrew from professional duties to contend with diagnoses of cancer (which he has overcome)
				
				
					Beate's husband and children, along with Karl Jr.'s wife, Gabriele Mertes, are all believed to have a share in the fortune
