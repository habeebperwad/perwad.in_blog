			In 2005, Thomas Struengmann and his twin brother, Andreas, who together founded generic drug maker Hexal AG in 1986, sold the business (along with their 68% stake in U.S.-based Eon Labs) to Novartis for $7.5 billion.  Since then, they've been actively investing in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Their holdings also include a private bank, Stuttgart-based Sudwestbank. In 2008, they established a neuroscience research center in Frankfurt named after their father, Ernst Struengmann. After obtaining a business degree from the University of Augsburg, Thomas worked as a marketing manager for the U.S. pharmaceutical company Schering-Plough. Like his brother, he is said to be an accomplished golfer and likes to ski. He reportedly collects modern art and Swiss watches.
