			Chung Eui-Sun is the only son of Hyundai Motor Co. Chairman Chung Mong-Koo and his heir apparent. After receiving an M.B.A. from University of San Francisco, Chung worked at the New York office of Japanese trading house Itochu Corp.  before joining Hyundai's auto parts affiliate, Hyundai Mobis, in 1994. As president of Kia from 2005 to 2009, he made over the company's brand image, hiring renowned automotive designer Peter Schreyer to phase out the bland, boxy styling that had made Kia models such as the Soul objects of derision among auto buffs. During his tenure at the helm, Kia grew faster than its Hyundai Motor affiliate--allowing Chung to begin to step outside the shadow cast by his formidable father, who is known for his obsession with quality and hard-charging management style. In 2009 Chung became vice chairman of Hyundai Motor. He was appointed to the company's board in 2010, bringing him a step closer to becoming the third generation of his family to lead Hyundai. In November 2015, appropriating the name of the company's full-size sedan, he announced "a new beginning for Hyundai Motor" with the launch of a global luxury brand, Genesis. While his father derives most of his wealth from his stake in Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Glovis Co. -- which functions as a holding company for stakes in Hyundai affiliates and also provides logistics services to those affiliates and other customers -- accounts for most of Eui-Sun's fortune. Outside of the business world, he is president of the Asian Archery Association, as his father once was.
