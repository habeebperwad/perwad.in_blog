			Dannine Avara and her three siblings inherited Enterprise Products Partners, the energy pipeline giant founded by their late father, Dan Duncan. Formerly the richest person in Houston, Duncan died in 2010 at age 77 of a brain hemorrhage.  He started Enterprise Products in 1968 with $10,000 and a truck; today the company owns nearly 49,000 miles of natural gas, oil and petrochemical pipelines. Duncan split his fortune evenly between all four children: Avara, Scott Duncan, Milane Frantz and Randa Duncan Williams. Randa serves as non-executive chairman of the Enterprise Products board.
