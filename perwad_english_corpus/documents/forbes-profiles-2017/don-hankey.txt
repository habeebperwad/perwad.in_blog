			Don Hankey is the little-known king of subprime car loans. He presides over the $1.6 billion (sales) Hankey Group, an auto services empire that derives much of its income from Westlake Financial Services, a lender working with more than 18,000 car dealerships in all 50 states to provide loans to people with bad, or no, credit.  Another of Hankey's companies, Nowcom, develops software that lets salespeople at Westlake and other companies scrape an individual's credit reports and financial documents for data to determine interest rates and whether to extend a car loan. Other Hankey companies including Knight Insurance, Midway Car Rental and North Hollywood Toyota help customers buy a second hand car, finance it and insure it. The returns-obsessed Hankey regularly rents out his Malibu beach house for filming commercials, TV shows and movies, including Entourage, CSI: Miami and Charlie's Angels.
