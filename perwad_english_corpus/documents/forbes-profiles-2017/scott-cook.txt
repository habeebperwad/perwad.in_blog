			Scott Cook cofounded financial software giant Intuit, the company known for products like QuickBooks, TurboTax and web-based personal finance tool Mint. After getting an MBA from Harvard, Cook worked for Procter & Gamble and Bain & Company before launching Intuit in 1983. He was inspired to strike out on his own when his wife became frustrated by how long it took to manage the family finances.  In June 2016, Cook and his wife, Signe Ostby, signed the Giving Pledge, vowing to give away the majority of their wealth to "driving social progress in the world."
