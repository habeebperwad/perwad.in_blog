					Xu started out in the cookie business and then ended up acquiring 120 food brands. 
				
				
					Dali went public in November 2015 on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
				
				
					Xu works seven days a week and says he hopes his work style inspires managers to emulate him. (He met FORBES ASIA  in his office in 2016 during a national holiday.) 

				
				
					He's the son of a laborer who got a job at Dali when it was a collective and amassed shares by proving that he was a leader who'd turn the business around.
