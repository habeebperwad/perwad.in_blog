			Bill Alfond owes his fortune to one smart trade. In 1993 his father, Harold Alfond,  gave Warren Buffett his Dexter Shoe Company in exchange for a chunk of Berkshire Hathaway stock. The Alfonds have made a fortune from the rising value of those shares.  In 1958 Harold, a onetime factory worker who never went to college, bought an old mill in Dexter, Maine and turned it into the Dexter Shoe Company. It eventually sold millions of boots and causal shoes a year. After trading the company to Buffett in 1993 Harold focused on philanthropy, donating millions to universities and hospitals across Maine before he died in 2007. Bill is one of four children of Harold who share the fortune; all are billionaires. The family owns a small stake in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool FC plus stakes in Roush Fenway Racing and New England Sports Network.
