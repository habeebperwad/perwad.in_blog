			John Arrillaga built a fortune in Silicon Valley real estate. After graduating from Stanford University, which he attended thanks to a basketball scholarship, Arrillaga partnered with Richard "Dick" Peery, buying farmland in Silicon Valley in the 1960s and turning it into office parks.  Their Peery-Arrillaga firm sold about half its commercial real estate portfolio in 2006 for $1.1 billion. Current tenants include Google and Intuit. In 2013 Stanford announced that Arrillaga was giving the university $151 million, its largest gift from a living donor. Arrillaga's name adorns several buildings on the Stanford University campus.
