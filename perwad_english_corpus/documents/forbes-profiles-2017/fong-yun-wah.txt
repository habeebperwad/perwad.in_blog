			Fong Yun Wah heads Hip Shing Hong Group, one of Hong Kong's largest private real estate investment companies. Founded in 1948, it focuses on office, residential and industrial properties, and controls more than 2 million square feet of space.  The company's roots date to 1927, when Fong arrived in Hong Kong with his father from Guangdong Province. An early sesame-seed-processing business eventually gave way to property investment. His son David is managing director and grandson Jonathan works under him as an assistant project manager.
