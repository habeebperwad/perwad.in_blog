			Former lawyer and Google employee Chris Sacca built a fortune as a super angel through his firm Lowercase Capital. He invested his own money early in Twitter and then put in more funds raised from Silicon Valley tech execs and friends.  Sacca's fund amassed a position in Twitter worth more than $1 billion when the company went public in November 2013. He's since sold his Twitter shares. Now the vast majority of his wealth lies in Uber, the (still private) ride-hailing service valued at $66 billion. Sacca's brutal honesty has alienated some former friends; he has said he hasn't been on speaking terms with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick for several years. Known for wearing embroidered cowboy shirts, Sacca sometimes appears as a guest shark on the TV show 'Shark Tank.'
