			Hong Ra-Hee is the director of Leeum Samsung Museum of Art and the wife of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-Hee, Korea's richest person. Her husband suffered a heart attack in 2014 and was hospitalized amidst a major restructuring of the family empire driven in part by the need to start transferring control to the next generation.  Since then, little concrete information has emerged about Lee's condition. Hong's only son and heir to the country's largest conglomerate, Jay Y. Lee, was indicted and jailed on bribery charges in February 2017. He denies any wrongdoing. His trial began in March 2017. Hong's billionaire daughters run affiliate Samsung C&T. Lee Seo-Hyun heads the company's fashion division, while Lee Boo-Jin oversees a resort, theme park and construction activities. Hong's father was chairman of one of Korea's largest-circulation newspaper, JoongAng Daily, currently run by her brother Hong Suk-Hyeon. Although not involved in Samsung's management, Hong gets her fortune from her stake in Samsung Electronics and is active in running the museum and in philanthropic work. She is known for being a prolific buyer of art.
