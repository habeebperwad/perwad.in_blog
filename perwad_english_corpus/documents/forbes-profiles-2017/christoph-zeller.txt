			Millions of people are better off today thanks to products that have made Christoph Zeller a billionaire, yet few have ever never heard of him or his company. Headquartered in Schaan, Principality of Liechtenstein, Ivoclar Vivadent AG produces dental products and systems including filling materials as well as fixed and removable prosthetics.  The company was founded in Zurich in 1923 focusing on the production of artificial teeth and bought by Zeller's grandfather, Dr. Adolph Schneider, in 1948. A citizen of Liechtenstein, Zeller served as CEO and chairman from 1990 to 1993, when he stepped down as CEO. Today, Ivoclar Vivadent has subsidiaries in 25 countries, employs more than 3,300 people and generates annual revenue in excess of $750 million.
