			The son of Polish immigrants, Izzy Englander left Wall Street to start hedge fund firm Millennium Management in 1989 with $35 million from friends and family; today the company manages more than $34 billion.  Englander's shop uses a multi-manager platform, farming out cash to dozens of teams, feeding more capital to those who perform well and getting rid of those who perform poorly. He doesn't charge fixed fees and makes money only when his investors profit. His firm has been one of the best performing hedge funds in recent years, producing double-digit returns for its investors; in 2016, however, Millennium saw its lowest gain since the 2008 financial crisis, with returns up by 3.4% over the past year.
