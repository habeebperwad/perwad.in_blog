			Turkey's LC Waikiki, a producer and retailer of ready-to-wear fashions and home items, aims to become one of the three most successful brands in Europe by 2023. Adding the name of the famous Hawaiian beach to "LC," as in "Les Copains" ("friends" in French), French designer Georges Amouyal and his partner created the brand in France in 1988. Mustafa Kucuk and his partners (including billionaire Sefik Yilmaz Dizdar) purchased the business in 1997, and decided to sell its wares exclusively through their own chain of stores.  Today it operates over 700 stores in some 34 countries, generating over $2 billion in sales. Mustafa's brother, Vahap Kucuk, is CEO and spokesman.
