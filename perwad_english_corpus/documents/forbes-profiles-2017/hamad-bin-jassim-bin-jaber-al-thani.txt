			Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, whose great uncle founded modern Qatar in 1971, is the country's former prime minister. Through an entity called Paramount Services Holdings, Al Thani owns about 3% of Deustche Bank, as well as a stake in publicly traded Gulf Warehousing, a Qatar-based logistics company.  He was one of 140 politicians mentioned in the "Panama Papers," a May 2016 disclosure of leaked files from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, which helped many of its clients by creating offshore entities and shell companies. Al Thani's ties to several shell companies, made public in the leaked documents, show ownership of Al Mirqab, a 133-meter superyacht worth an estimated $300 million.
