			Abdullah Al Rajhi formed Al Rajhi Bank more than 50 years ago with his brothers Sulaiman, Mohammed, and Saleh (who has passed away). It is one of the largest Islamic banks in the world. Their sons now hold seats on the board of the publicly-traded bank.  Al Rajhi also owns a stake in Islamic bank powerhouse Al Baraka Banking Group, founded by fellow Saudi Arabian billionaire Saleh Kamel. Other holdings include stakes in cement and agriculture companies.
