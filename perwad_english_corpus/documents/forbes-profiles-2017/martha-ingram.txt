			Martha Ingram took over her family's distribution and marine firm Ingram Industries in 1995 after her husband Bronson Ingram died. She spun off the computer distribution unit into publicly traded Ingram Micro in 1996. In December 2016, Ingram Micro was acquired by Chinese company HNA Group.  Martha led Ingram Industries until 2008 when sons Orrin and John took over. One part of the business, Ingram Content, provides distribution, on-demand printing and digital services to big players in the book publishing industry, like Amazon, Barnes and Noble, O'Reilly Media, Taschen, Penguin Random House, Grove Atlantic and hundreds of independent publishers. Ingram Marine operates 5,000 barges and more than 140 towboats on America's inland waterways. Another son, David, runs Ingram Entertainment, an independent firm. Martha Ingram sits on the boards of various cultural institutions in Nashville, Tennessee.
