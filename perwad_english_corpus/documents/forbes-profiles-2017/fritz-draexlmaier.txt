			The story of Draexlmaier Group -- founded by Fritz Draexlmaier Sr. and his wife, Lisa, in Vilsbiburg, Germany -- begins in 1958 with an order for 50,000 wiring harnesses for the Goggomobil, a microcar produced by Hans Glas GmbH.  The expertise the company developed producing automotive wiring harnesses -- which run throughout the entire vehicle and are akin to a central nervous system, connecting electrical components and relaying data and electrical power -- paved the way for expanding into the manufacture of electronic components, consoles, door and instrument panels and exclusive interiors for specific models. Today, Draexlmaier counts among its customers Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Jaguar, Land Rover, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Tesla and Volkswagen. With revenue exceeding $3.9 billion, the owner-led company employs more than 55,000 people in 20 countries. Fritz is the only child of Fritz Sr., who died in 1995 at age 80, and Lisa.
