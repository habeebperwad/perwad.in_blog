			Aristotelis Mistakidis, known as "Telis, is the director of Glencore's copper business and owns a 3% stake in the commodities and mining giant. A citizen of both the United Kingdom and his native Greece, he attained billionaire status in 2011 when the IPO of Glencore went public on the London Stock Exchange.  He fell off in 2016 due to a weak commodities market, but is back this year thanks to company stocks rising 213%. Mistakidis got his start in the commodities business at Cargill and joined Marc Rich & Co. in 1993. Shortly after, the firm was bought by management and renamed Glencore. A London School of Economics graduate, he worked in what would become the zinc, copper and lead department, eventually rising to the rank of co-director in 2000.
