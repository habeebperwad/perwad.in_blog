			Maria Helena Moraes Scripilliti is daughter of Jose Ermirio de Moraes, who founded family-owned Grupo Votorantim, one of Latin America's largest diversified industrial conglomerates. Votorantim is present in more than 20 countries in the aluminum, pulp and paper, energy, agribusiness, and cement industries.  The group dates back to 1918, when Moraes Scripilliti's father bought a textile factory in Sao Paulo. The family still controls 100% of the business. Maria Helena's brother, Ermirio Pereira, is also a billionaire. Their other brother Antonio Ermirio ran to become governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest state; he died in 2014. Moraes Scripilliti's late husband, Clovis Scripilliti, helped expand Votorantim throughout northeast Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s. Their son Clovis Erm√≠rio de Moraes Scripilliti serves as vice chairman of the board.
