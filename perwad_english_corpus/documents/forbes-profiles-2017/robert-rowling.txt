			Oilman turned hotelier Rowling bought the Omni Hotel chain two decades ago for $500 million, redeploying the proceeds from selling oil and gas fields with his father Reese (d. 2001) to Texaco in 1989. The chain's 60 hotels, which have more than 20,000 rooms, include the Amelia Island Resort in Florida and the Mount Washington Resort in New Hampshire.  Omni's Barton Creek resort near Austin boasts an award-winning golf course by Tom Fazio. Omni is the largest hotel chain not to offer in-room adult movies. Rowling also owns the Golds Gym chain and is a big donor to Republican candidates. He gave $25 million to the University of Texas business school in 2013.
