			John Henry turned a fortune made in commodities trading into ownership of several big ticket sports teams. He and partner Tom Werner bought the Boston Red Sox in 2002; two years later the duo lifted the "Curse of the Bambino" and delivered Boston its first World Series win in 86 years.  The team has since gone on to win two more championships, the most recent in 2013. The Red Sox are worth $2.3 billion, according to FORBES. Henry also owns stakes in European soccer club Liverpool FC and Nascar team Roush Fenway Racing. He bought The Boston Globe newspaper in 2013 for $70 million.
