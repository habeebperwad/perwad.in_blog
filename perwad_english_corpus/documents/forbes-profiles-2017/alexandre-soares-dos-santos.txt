			After 45 years as chairman of Portuguese food retailer Jeronimo Martins, Alexandre Soares dos Santos stepped down in 2013, passing the leadership of the publicly-traded company to his son Pedro. The 13.7 billion euro in revenue business operates the Pingo Doce and Recheio chains in Portugal, the Biedronka chain in Poland and 142 Ara locations Colombia.  Jeronimo Martins traces its roots to 1792; the dos Santos family has controlled it since 1921. Alexandre took over the business from his father and Pedro is the fourth generation of family to run the business. Now CEO, Pedro started at Jeronimo Martins at age 23 and has moved up the ranks over the last 30 years.
