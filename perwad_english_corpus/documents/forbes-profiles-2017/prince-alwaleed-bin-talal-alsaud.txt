			High-profile Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal owns chunks of private and public companies in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East through Kingdom Holding Co., 5% of which is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (he is listed as owning the other 95%). Holdings include stakes in ride-sharing firm Lyft, social media firm Twitter, Citigroup, hotel management company Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, the swanky Hotel George V in Paris and the Savoy Hotel in London.  Outside of Kingdom Holding, the Prince owns real estate in Saudi Arabia, the majority of Arabic-language entertainment firm Rotana, and other assets. Prince Alwaleed, who bought Donald Trump's yacht in 1991, called out Trump on Twitter in June 2016, saying he should drop out of the presidential race "as you will never win." After Trump won the U.S. election in November, Alwaleed congratulated him on Twitter. In December 2016, Alwaleed joined Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Coalition with the promise of a $50 million investment.
