			In 2004 Magdalena Martullo-Blocher took the reins of Ems-Chemie, the gigantic Swiss polymer and chemical manufacturer that's been in her family for years. This came after her father, Christoph Blocher, departed the company after 35 years to take a seat in the Swiss government's federal council.  Upon leaving he sold his stake evenly to his four children. Magdalena and her sister Rahel hold shares equally through family holding company, Emesta. Sister Miriam and brother Markus have sold shares to Magdalena and Rahel over the years to run their own companies. Before joining the Ems-Chemie board of directors in 2001, Magdalena held management positions at Johnson & Johnson and Swiss beverage maker Rivella. In 2015, Magdalena followed in her father footsteps into politics: she was elected to the Swiss parliament as a National Councillor. She ran on the conservative Swiss People's Party ticket, of which father Christoph is a high-ranking leader.
