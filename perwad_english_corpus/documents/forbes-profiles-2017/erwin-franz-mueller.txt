			Erwin Franz Mueller owns an eponymous drugstore chain with over 757 stores across seven European countries. Akin to Walgreens except without pharmacies, Mueller stores sell health and beauty products, fragrances, stationery, toys, multimedia, household items, handicrafts and over-the-counter drugs.  The business dates to 1953, when Mueller opened a hairdressing shop in his home in Ulm, Germany. Mueller Ltd. now has about 34,000 employees and annual revenue of around $4.6 billion. It has maintained steady top-line growth despite a series of executive departures in recent years, reportedly in part due to disagreements with Mueller and power play within the family business. German authorities had accused Mueller of evading taxes by hiding a portion of his assets in Swiss private bank J. Safra Sarasin but prosecutors stopped proceedings in 2016. He claimed the bank made questionable tax deals behind his back and has sued for some $55 million in damages. Mueller is believed to own about $1.1 billion of real estate assets, including a house and a golf course in Mallorca. He married his second wife, Anita, in 2006.
