			Haim Saban turned his success with children's TV show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers into Fox Family Channel, a joint venture with News Corp. Disney bought the channel in 2001 for $5 billion; his take was $1.7 billion.  Now Saban chairs Spanish language TV network Univision Communications, which filed to go public in July 2015 but has yet to do so. Saban and a group of private equity investors purchased the broadcaster for $13.7 billion (including some $10 billion in debt) in 2007. Univision bought the assets of bankrupt media firm Gawker for $135 million in August 2016.  Born in Egypt to Jewish parents, Saban moved with his family to Tel Aviv when he was a child and lived in a one-room flat. He moved to the U.S. as an adult to try his luck in Hollywood.
