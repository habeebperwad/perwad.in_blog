			Father and son Kapil & Rahul Bhatia get the bulk of their wealth from Bombay stock Exchange-listed InterGlobe Aviation, which owns IndiGo, India's largest and most profitable airline, with a market share of 40%. The airline, which was cofounded with billionaire airline veteran Rakesh Gangwal, began flying in 2006 and flew past older rivals on its reputation for punctuality.  Today it has a fleet of 126 aircraft and flies to 41 destinations, including 5 overseas. Fare wars took a toll on the budget carrier's net profit, which declined 25% to $73 million in a recent quarter. IndiGo's on-time performance has slipped lately partly due to engine problems with the newly-inducted Airbus A320neo aircraft. The Bhatias are mulling a public listing of their travel commerce firm InterGlobe Technology Quotient.
