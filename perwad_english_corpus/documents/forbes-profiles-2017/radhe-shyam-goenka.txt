			Radhe Shyam Goenka cofounded consumer goods firm Emami in 1974 with his best pal Radhe Shyam Agarwal. The $400 million (revenue) maker of health, herbal and beauty products is well-known for such brands as Fair and Handsome, a skin lightening cream for men and celebrity and sports star endorsements for its products.  Emami had filed a case against herbal consumer goods maker Patanjali, cofounded by new billionaire Acharya Balkrishna, for allegedly copying the design of Emami's Kesh King bottle for Patanjali's Kesh Kanti bottles. The companies settled out of court and Patanjali changed the packaging.
