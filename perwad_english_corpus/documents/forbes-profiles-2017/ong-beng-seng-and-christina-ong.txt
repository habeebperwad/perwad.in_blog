			Husband and wife Ong Beng Seng and Christina Ong are one of Singapore's most influential couples. Ong, a Malaysian citizen and Singapore permanent resident, is managing director of Singapore-listed Hotel Properties, which includes such brands as Four Seasons, Hilton International and InterContinental Hotels, among much else.  Christina runs COMO Hotels & Resorts, retail empire Club 21 and London-listed handbag maker Mulberry. The Ongs, who were embroiled in a legal dispute with Christina's siblings, Peter Fu Chong Cheng and Juanita Fu, over the division of the family assets, recently settled out of court.  The Fus have reportedly agreed to relinquish their stake in listed Hotel Properties to the Ongs in exchange for taking full control of privately held oil and commodities trader Kuo International, which was founded by Christina's late father, Peter Fu Yun Siak.
