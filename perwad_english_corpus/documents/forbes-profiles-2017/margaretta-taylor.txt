			Margaretta Taylor and her siblings, James Cox Chambers and Katharine Rayner, are heirs to the Cox family fortune. Their grandfather, James M. Cox, founded what has become Cox Enterprises, an automotive and media conglomerate.  They received a 50% stake in the business from their mother, Anne Cox Chambers, 96, in an asset shuffling that became public in 2015. Neither Anne nor her children have ever had an active role at Cox Enterprises, which includes such brands as Autotrader.com and publications like The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Margaretta's son, Alex, however, is the company's chief operating officer and a director. Her cousin, fellow billionaire Jim Kennedy, is its chairman and its former CEO. Like her sister, Katharine, Margaretta focuses on philanthropy: She has donated to the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Atlanta Humane Society.
