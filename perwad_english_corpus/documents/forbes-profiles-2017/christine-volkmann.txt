			Christine Volkmann is the granddaughter of Max Brose, founder of the namesake German auto-parts maker. Her brother Michael Stoschek took over the company in 1971. Under his leadership, Brose evolved from a national manufacturer into a world market leader in electrical and mechanical components and integrated systems that are largely invisible to vehicle drivers.  It's now the world's fifth-largest family-owned automotive supplier. Approximately 24,000 employees work for the company at 60 locations in 23 countries. Annual revenues top $6.4 billion.
