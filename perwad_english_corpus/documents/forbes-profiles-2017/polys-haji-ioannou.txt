			Brother of easyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, Polys' fortune comes largely from his stake in the budget airline. Polys is also something of a shipping magnate, controlling transport group Polyar Tankers, which has managed oil tankers out of Norway since 1993. Shipping runs in the family: father Loucas Haji-Ioannou, the self-styled "King of Tankers," got into the business in the 1950s and purchased his first oil tanker in 1969. Born to a poor Cypriot family in the Troodos Mountains, which later lent its name to the family company Troodos Shipping, Loucas made his fortune from transporting oil.  Polys is based in Monaco, but owns property in Greece, Singapore and India, to name a few.
