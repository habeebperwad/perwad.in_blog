			With his brother Joe, Mark Shoen owns nearly 43% of U-Haul parent company Amerco through a limited partnership called Willow Grove. As part of a 2016 restructuring, Mark also folded in Blackwater Investments, which has one of the largest private self-storage operations in the U.  S. (many of which are managed under U-Haul). His parents Leonard Samuel and Anna Mary Shoen cofounded the truck and trailer rental company back in 1945. The company thrived in the postwar Baby Boom, becoming the dominant player in the industry before hitting some bumps in the late 1970s amid the fuel crisis. Some of the 12 children, who were each given equal shares of the company, grew restless with the company's direction, and in 1986 Mark and brothers Joe and James wrested control of U-Haul from their father, sparking decades of lawsuits and vicious family fighting among the siblings. Their dad eventually committed suicide. Mark keeps a very low profile but apparently remains on good terms with Joe, who still runs the business.
