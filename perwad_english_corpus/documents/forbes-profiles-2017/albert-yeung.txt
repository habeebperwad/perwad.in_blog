His Emperor International Holdings also counts property and--in North Korea and Macau--casino interests.  The Macau casino sports red-coated faux Coldstream Guards and real gold bars imbedded in the lobby floor. The self-made tycoon says he always carries 40,000 or 50,000 in Hong Kong dollars to ward off feelings of inferiority.
