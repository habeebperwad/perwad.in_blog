			Jacqueline Mars owns a third of the world's largest candymaker, Mars Inc., the company her grandfather started in his kitchen in 1911. The secretive company makes some of America's favorite guilty pleasures -- M&M's, Milky Way and Dove chocolate -- plus food products like Uncle Ben's rice, but is even bigger in the world of pet products.  Mars owns five billion-dollar pet brands, including Iams and Whiskas, and in January 2017 agreed to pay $7.7 billion for VCA Inc., an operator of nearly 800 animal hospitals and 137 pet day care centers. Jacqueline joined the family business in 1982, where she oversaw the development and marketing of new food products. She retired in 2001 but remained on the board until 2016. Her brother, John, also owns a third of Mars Inc. as did her brother Forrest Jr. until his death in July 2016 at age 84. Her niece Victoria Mars, daughter of Forrest Jr., is Mars' current chairman. Jacqueline, a horse lover, sits of the Board of Trustees of the U.S. Equestrian Team and owns a Virginia farm that has trained horses ridden by Olympic medalists. She also grows hay and organic vegetables at the farm. She serves on the boards of six other organizations, including the Smithsonian, the National Archives and the Washington National Opera, where she is chairman.
