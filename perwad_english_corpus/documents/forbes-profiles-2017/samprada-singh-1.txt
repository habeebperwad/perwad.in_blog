			Farmer's son Samprada Singh, who hails from a village in Bihar in eastern India, worked at a chemist's store before venturing out on his own distributing pharmaceuticals. He later got into manufacturing in Mumbai with a friend but that unraveled, and he broke away to set up Alkem Laboratories in 1973. Today it is one of the nation's top 10 generic firms, known for such antibiotic brands as Clavam and Taxim.  Alkem's shares have almost doubled since its 2015 IPO on rising revenues and earnings. Alkem's office in Mumbai is decorated with photos of Singh with the quote "Yet miles to go. Yet a lot to be done."
