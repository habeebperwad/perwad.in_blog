			With partners and longtime friends Alexander Machkevich and Patokh Chodiev (both billionaires), Alijan Ibragimov is trying to revive the fortunes of Eurasian Natural Resources Co., a metals and mining empire in Kazakhstan, which they delisted in 2013 after a market downturn stalled growth and fraud investigations mounted.  They also remain in court over a $220 million claim ENRC allegedly failed to pay the final installment for a Brazilian iron ore mine to Zamin owned by Laskhmi Mittal's right hand man, Pramod Agarwal. A native of Uzbekistan, Ibragimov moved to Kazakhstan when the group decided to pursue business interests there. A devout Muslim, he has 6 sons.
