			Since co-founding private equity firm First Reserve in 1983, Bill Macaulay has presided over 450 transactions involving mining, solar power and insurance companies. First Reserve now has over $11 billion in assets under management.  Macaulay grew up in the Bronx, studied economics at the City University of New York, and spent the 1970s in Oppenheimer's private equity business. Over the years Macaulay has given more than $30 million to fund the Macaulay Honors College at CUNY. With his wife Linda, a professional ornithologist, he has donated millions to Cornell; the Macaulay Library there now holds world's largest collection of wildlife sounds. He often carries his wife's recording equipment when the two track birds in wild. "I like bird watching," he says. "It's quiet."
