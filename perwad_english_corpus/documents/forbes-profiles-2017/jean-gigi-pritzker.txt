			Hyatt heiress Jean "Gigi" Pritzker was invited to join The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science in June 2016 - one of the biggest testaments yet to her growing play to produce Hollywood films. Among her biggest silver screen successes: Drive, the Ryan Gosling-led flick, and action-packed Ender's Game.  In 2014, she announced she was backing a new movie studio, STX Entertainment, with fellow producer Robert Simonds, private-equity firm TPG Capital and China's Hony Capital. Gigi also owns a steel-mill-servicing company, TMS International, which she and her brother Thomas bought for $1 billion, including debt. Her grandfather, A.N. Pritzker (d. 1986), with his sons Jay (her father; d. 1999), Robert (d. 2011) and Donald (D. 1972), created Marmon and hotel chain Hyatt. She still owns 14% of Hyatt common stock.
