			Tom & Judy love are the founders of convenience store chain Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores. The company opened 47 new locations in 2016 and plans to open another 50 in 2017. In March 2016, Love's purchased Trillium CNG, a compressed natural gas provider for an undisclosed sum.  They got their start in 1964 when they leased a gas station in Watonga, Oklahoma for $5,000. A few years later, they launched a convenience store. Today, Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores is a national chain with more than 400 locations in 40 states. Located along interstates, they offer gas stations, convenience stores, fast food restaurants, showers and trucking supplies. The company remains family-owned and operated. Tom is chairman and CEO, and three of the couple's four children work for the company.
