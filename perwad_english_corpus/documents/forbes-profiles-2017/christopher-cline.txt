			Cline sold a big chunk of his shares in coal miner Foresight Energy for $1.4 billion. It was right before the coal industry imploded. Cline still hopes that Foresight, with its young mines and thick reserves of high-sulfur coal, will be among the last standing.  As a child in West Virginia this son and grandson of coal miners earned a penny a bag excavating dirt from under the family's front porch. When the porch collapsed he learned a valuable lesson about the importance of engineering roof supports in coal mines. In the 1990s, Cline bought coal reserves in the Illinois Basin, acquiring mines from the likes of U.S. Steel and Exxon. Cline believed correctly that innovations and pollution control technology would make that Illinois coal clean again. Now with coal companies going under, Cline is plotting to gobble up more mines. In 2016 he reopened an old mine in Nova Scotia. Cline lives in North Palm Beach, Fla.
