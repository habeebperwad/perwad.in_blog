He was 101, making him the oldest billionaire in the 2017 rankings of the world's richest, which was published on the day of his death.  An heir to the Rockefeller family fortune, he served in North Africa and France in military intelligence during World War II. He then ran Chase National Bank for years. A philanthropist, he donated $150 million to New York's Museum of Modern Art, which his mother co-founded. "No individual has contributed more to the commercial and civic life of New York City over a longer period of time than David Rockefeller," said Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of the city and a billionaire entrepreneur, following news of the death.
