			Bernard "Barry" Sherman created Apotex, one of Canada's largest pharmaceutical companies, which sells over 260 generic drugs in more than 115 countries. In 1974, armed with a doctorate in rocket science from MIT, Sherman used his mother's life savings to buy his uncle's drug company.  Starting with two employees, he expanded the company to a workforce of more than 10,000. Its medicines are used to fill over 89 million prescriptions a year in Canada alone, and annual global revenues are $1.5 billion. Apotex says it plans to spend $2 billion over the next decade to research new drugs. It also makes fine chemicals, non-prescription drugs and disposable plastics for medical use. Sherman stepped down as CEO in 2014 but remains chairman. In October 2016, Apotex sued the Canadian government for $500 million, claiming its bottom line and reputation suffered after it was barred from importing products from its Indian facilities in 2014. In late 2016, Canada's lobbying watchdog launched an investigation into whether Sherman was offering "cash for access" when he helped organize a $500-a-ticket fundraiser for a Liberal party candidate. A spokesman for Sherman did not respond to a request for comment.
