			James Cargill II inherited an estimated 7% stake in Cargill, the company his great-grandfather founded with a single grain storage warehouse at the end of an Iowa railroad line in 1865. Now the largest private company in America, Cargill has operations all over the world.  It hauled in $107 billion in revenues in 2016 selling food, processing crops, trading commodities, sourcing ingredients and offering financial risk management. The last time Cargill failed to turn a profit over the course of an entire year was in 1938. The Cargill-MacMillan family collects an estimated 18% of net profits as dividends every year.
