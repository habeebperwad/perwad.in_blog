			William Conway Jr. is one of three billionaires who founded and controls the $158 billion (assets) private equity firm Carlyle Group. He serves as co-CEO along with David Rubenstein. Daniel D'Aniello is chairman.  The trio took Carlyle public on the Nasdaq exchange in 2012. He first arrived in Washington, D.C. while working for MCI Communications as chief financial officer. In 1987, he co-founded Carlyle with Rubenstein and D'Aniello. They named it Carlyle because they hashed out early deals at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. The trio used their Beltway connections--George H.W. Bush was among their advisers--to invest in defense-oriented companies. Conway is an active philanthropist. He promised to give away at least $1 billion, and has chosen to focus on education. Conway, who studied at Dartmouth and the University of Chicago, has given away at least $55 million in scholarships and tuition-assistance for nursing programs at several Washington, D.C.-based universities.
