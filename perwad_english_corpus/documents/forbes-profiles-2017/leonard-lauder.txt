			New York's cosmetics king is officially off the market. Leonard Lauder, Estee Lauder's largest shareholder, married longtime friend Judith Glickman in early 2015. (His first wife, Evelyn, died in 2011). Lauder, the eldest son of the eponymous investor maven, joined his mother's company in 1958. While running the beauty giant for nearly three decades, he made headlines for promoting the Lipstick Index, an economic indicator that suggested makeup sales were tied to economic certainty.  He stepped down as CEO in 1999 but remains on the board. His son, William, is now the executive chairman. His other son, Gary, also maintains a stake in the company. Lauder helped fund, with a $131 million donation, the new home of the Whitney Museum of American Art in NYC's Meatpacking District. His $1 billion plus Cubist collection was on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art earlier this year.
