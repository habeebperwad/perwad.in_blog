			Youngest son of makeup maven Estee Lauder, Ron Lauder is chairman of Clinique Laboratories, but spends most of his time advocating for Jewish causes. It started when he encountered anti-semitism as U.S. ambassador to Austria from 1986 to 1987. Testifying in Congress in 2015 over recent events of anti-semitism following the Charlie Hebdo attacks, he said "European leaders have stepped up and strongly condemned these attacks on Jews and the rise of anti-Semitism.  The United States must do the same. The United States must lead." He has also been pushing museums across Europe to return art stolen by the Nazis to the descendants of their original owners in a years-long campaign. That's a particularly fitting role for Lauder, who owns a massive art collection with 4,000 works worth at least $1 billion.
