			Alan Howard runs Brevan Howard Asset Management, a big European hedge fund specializing in macro trading. The firm continues to be snake bitten by asset outflows and investors redeemed another $7 billion in 2016. Howard's main hedge fund returned about 3% net of fees in 2016, continuing a recent string of uninspiring returns.
