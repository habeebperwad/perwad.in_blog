			Born into a working-class family, John Caudwell started selling mobile phones with his brother, Brian, in 1987. Six years later the brothers founded Singlepoint, a mobile service provider. By the time Vodafone acquired it in 2003 for $650 million, the firm had 1.9 million customers.  Caudwell pumped his share of the money into Phones 4u, which grew into the U.K.'s largest independent mobile phone retailer. He flipped it three years later, selling the majority stake to Providence Equity Partners for $2.8 billion. In 2011, he sold his remaining 25% stake for $272 million. Three years later, he watched the business collapse abruptly when a number of networks decided to stop selling through Phone 4u's stores. PwC, administrator of the failed firm, is reportedly planning a legal action worth more than $1 billion against Vodafone, EE and O2, accusing the mobile operators of colluding to force Phones 4u's demise. Today Caudwell invests in real estate, fitness clubs and other industries. Starting in 2015, three former employees of Caudwell's businesses have sued him over claims that he wrongfully fired them to recoup shares worth millions or avoid paying bonuses. He declined to comment on the suits but has denied all allegations in press reports. Caudwell is dating Lithuanian cycling champion and former Olympian Modesta Vzesniauskaite.
