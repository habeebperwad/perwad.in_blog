			From humble beginnings in Butler, Pennsylvania, Daniel D'Aniello became one of three billionaires who cofounded private equity firm Carlyle Group. Today he chairs the $158 billion (assets) Carlyle Group and runs the firm's day-to-day operations.  Growing up, D'Aniello helped his single mom pay the bills by bagging groceries. He attended Syracuse University on a scholarship, studying transportation economics, then got an M.B.A. at Harvard. D'Aniello took jobs at Trans World Airlines, Pepsi and Marriott before joining William Conway and David Rubenstein to start Carlyle in 1987. They made smart use of politically connected advisers--George H.W. Bush was one--and accumulated their early fortunes by buying defense-oriented firms. D'Aniello has made charitable gifts to several universities including his alma mater, Syracuse University.
