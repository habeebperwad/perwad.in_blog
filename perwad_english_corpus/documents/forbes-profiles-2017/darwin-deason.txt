			A former Arkansas farm boy whose family often didn't have a dollar to spare for the movies, Darwin Deason left his small town the day after he graduated high school, with $50 borrowed from his dad and a 1949 Pontiac.  He headed for the "bright lights, big city" of Tulsa, Oklahoma and got a job at Gulf Oil. He eventually joined Dallas data-processing firm MTech and later took it over after all but his division failed. Deason became CEO at age 29, sold MTech in 1988 and within days started Affiliated Computer Services to handle computer and other business process services. It eventually handled services for clients such as E-ZPass. He later took ACS public and then sold it to Xerox for $6.4 billion in 2010. Deason, who once said that "if success is a happy family, coaching your kids' games, then don't become an entrepreneur," is married to his fifth wife, Katerina, 27 years his junior. They split their time these days between Dallas, San Diego and their 205-foot yacht "Apogee."
