			The oil and gas bust has gutted the value of Rod Lewis' oil and gas operations on 500,000 acres in south Texas, where he's been drilling for four decades years. "We'll survive because we've rolled back our cash into the company," he says.  "Reinvested in the ground." Lewis's other passion has always been airplanes. The son of an Air Force pilot, he bought his first in 1981 (an Aeronca Chief) because he was tired of driving Texas' wide-open spaces to check gauges on oil and gas wells. After a bout with esophageal cancer in 2004, he began buying up other planes in earnest. Lewis now owns two dozen Warbirds -- World War II-era planes -- including a P-51 Mustang and one of only two surviving T-6G trainer planes used by the Tuskegee airmen. His famed racer Rare Bear holds the speed record for piston-driven aircraft. He also has a B-25 bomber that he flew at an event honoring the 70th anniversary of Doolittle's raid. "But I'm just flying around," he says. "They were actually fighting, and trying to save their ass, for our country." The jewel of the collection is Glacier Girl, a P-38 Lightning dug out of the Greenland ice and restored to mint condition.
