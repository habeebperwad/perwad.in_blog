			Heiress Pauline MacMillan Keinath is believed to be the biggest individual shareholder in Cargill, America's largest private company. She has an estimated 12% stake in the $107 billion (2016 sales) company, a larger share than any of her 13 billionaire relatives.  Her great-grandfather W.W. Cargill, the son of a Scottish sea captain, started the business in 1865 with a single grain-storage warehouse at the end of an Iowa railroad line. He got rich as railroads expanded west and opened up the frontier. The Cargill and MacMillan families are no longer involved in management, but together they still own roughly 90% of the company.
