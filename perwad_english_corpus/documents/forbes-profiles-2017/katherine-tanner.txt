			Katherine Tanner inherited an estimated 3% stake in Cargill, the largest private company in America, when her father, W. Duncan MacMillan, died in 2006. Her great-great grandfather, W.W. Cargill, started the business back in 1865 with just one warehouse at the end of an Iowa railroad line.  Tanner's great-grandfather, John MacMillan Sr., took over when W.W. died in 1909, then later passed the company leadership to her grandfather. She and her three sisters -- Sarah MacMillan, Alexandra Daitch and Lucy Stitzer -- are all billionaires today.
