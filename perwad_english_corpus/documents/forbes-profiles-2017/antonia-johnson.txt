			Sweden's richest woman, Antonia Ax:son Johnson, was the fourth generation to run her family conglomerate until she stepped down as chairman in March 2015 and handed the reigns over to her daughter, Caroline Berg.  Ax:son Johnson succeeded her father as head of the privately held, diversified trading company in 1982. She still  has a seat on the board, and all of the ownership. Founded by her great-grandfather in 1873, the conglomerate now has interests in energy, telecom, real estate and industrial products. It also holds a 50% stake in Axfood AB, one of the largest food companies in Scandinavia. Ax:son Johnson went to Radcliffe College in Cambridge, MA, as an exchange student in the early 1960s. She is an avid equestrian and breeder, and is the owner of Olympics-competing horses. The Ax:son Johnson family runs several large charitable foundations, and are major contributors to liberal arts and social sciences. In 2016, the family pledged $3 million to an UN research project in Stockholm focused on the future of urban planning.
