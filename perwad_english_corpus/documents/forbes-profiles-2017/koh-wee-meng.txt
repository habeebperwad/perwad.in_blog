			Singapore budget hotelier and property magnate Koh Wee Meng continued expanding in Australia, announcing plans to build two new hotels in Hobart, Tasmania. His Singapore-listed Fragrance Group is also developing a 77-story tower in Melbourne, which will feature close to 800 apartments and a 187-room hotel.  Son of a jeweler and school teacher, Koh broke away from the family's jewelry business, now known as Aspial, to start his own property venture in the 1990s. He was once known as the Geylang King for Fragrance's beginnings in Singapore's red light district.
