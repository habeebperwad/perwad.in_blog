			Shin Dong-Joo is the oldest son of Shin Kyeok-Ho, who founded Lotte as a confectionary manufacturer in Japan in 1948 and expanded into Korea in 1967. Today, Lotte Group is Korea's largest retailer and has other interests ranging from food and beverages to chemicals, construction and professional baseball.  In early 2015, Shin Dong-Joo was dismissed from his executive positions within the group. He had been overseeing Lotte's Japanese affiliates, which comprise a significantly smaller share of the group's assets than the Korean affiliates overseen by his brother, Shin Dong-Bin. Now the brothers are embroiled in a bitter feud for control over the group, and Dong-Joo appears to have lost the battle over Lotte Group.
