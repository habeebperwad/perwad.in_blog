			America's youngest female self-made billionaire, Sara Blakely owns and runs $400 million (est. sales) Spanx, the shapewear brand that promises to flatten tummies and firm butts. Today, Spanx is to slimming undergarments what Kleenex is to tissues: a brand that stands for the category.  A one-time door-to-door fax salesperson, Blakely founded the company at age 29, when she invested her $5,000 in savings to come up with something to wear under white slacks. In her first year she shilled her new invention from a folding table in the foyer of Neiman Marcus; the company now sells its wares, including athleisure and leggings, in 55 countries. Blakely is back to running Spanx on a daily basis after the firm's CEO left in early 2016.
