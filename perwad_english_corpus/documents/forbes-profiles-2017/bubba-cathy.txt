			With his brother Dan Cathy, Don "Bubba" Cathy runs fast-food juggernaut Chick-fil-A. Dan is CEO of the $6.8 billion (est. 2015 sales), 2,000-restaurant chain; Bubba is senior vice president and also oversees the company's 15 full-service restaurants in Georgia.  His father, Truett Cathy, who opened the first location in an Atlanta mall in 1967, died in September 2014 at the age of 93. His mother, Jeannette, died less than a year later in July 2015. The deeply religious family still closes Chick-fil-A's stores every Sunday so employees can go to church, and brothers both teach Sunday school every week. Bubba is also an avid motorcyclist and a longtime sailor.
