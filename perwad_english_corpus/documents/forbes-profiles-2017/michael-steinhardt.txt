			Pioneer of the modern hedge fund, Michael Steinhardt earned a fortune in the early 1990s with stellar returns and high-fees before closing shop in 1995. "I thought there must be something more virtuous, more ennobling to do with one's life than make rich people richer. " After a decade-long hiatus from finance, Steinhardt returned in 2004 -- this time working for the little guy. He is the chairman and largest individual shareholder of WisdomTree Investments, a publicly-traded ETF provider that claims to have a new spin on index-fund investing. Back in his trading days, Steinhardt returned an average of 24.5% annually to investors; WisdomTree also aims to beat the market, but just by a few percentage points. That's enough for investors, who have driven assets under management to more than $43 billion. He is also the cofounder of Birthright Israel.
