			Roman Trotsenko owns the Aeon Corporation, which controls 13 airports in Russia, the Moscow River Steamship Line, shipbuilding companies and several ports. In 2013, Aeon Corporation bought Moscow's Federation Tower from companies owned by former billionaire Sergey Polonsky, who was accused of fraud.  In December 2015, Trotsenko offered to pay bail of $286,000 for Polonsky's release, but the court extended his arrest. Trotsenko got his start as the financial director of a medical exchange at age 21. He claims he made his first million rubles the following year by trading in cigarettes.
