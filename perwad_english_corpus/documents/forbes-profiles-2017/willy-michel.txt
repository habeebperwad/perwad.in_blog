The company was born in 2003 out of Disetronic Holding, which Michel founded in 1984 with his brother and sold to Roche, a Swiss global healthcare company, for $1.2 billion.  He later repurchased the injection business back from Roche for $310 million, forming what is known as Ypsomed today. Willy and his three children together own a 75% stake in the company.
