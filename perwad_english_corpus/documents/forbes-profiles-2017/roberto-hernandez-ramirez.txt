			Former Banamex chief Roberto Hernandez Ramirez was paid some $2 billion in stock when Citigroup bought the Mexican bank in 2001. He remained on Citigroup's board until 2009, a year when the bank's share price fell precipitously.  Currently, Hernandez is on the board of Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa (run by billionaire Emilio Azcarraga Jean). He dedicates much of his time to preservation efforts, and has created two foundations focused on the environment and Mayan cultural heritage. Hernandez is also on the board of the Nature Conservancy and of the World Monuments Fund, from which he received the 2013 Hadrian Award for efforts to help preserve the Yaxchilan archeological site, the San Miguel Arcangel convent in Mani, the Church of Santa Prisca in Taxco, and the Las Pozas gardens, which are peppered with surrealist sculptures, in Xixitla.
