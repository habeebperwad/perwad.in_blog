			Charles Bronfman is long removed from the 2000 deal in which he and brother Edgar Bronfman Sr. sold their family's Seagram spirits empire to Vivendi for $34 billion. Since then he has turned much of his focus on philanthropy, authoring two books on the subject and signing Warren Buffett's and Bill Gates' Giving Pledge.  In January 2016 one of his major philanthropic vehicles, The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies, made its last grants and shut down. Bronfman announced in 2011 that the foundation would gradually spend down its resources and ultimately close to make way for his children's' philanthropic passions. In all, Charles has given away or pledged more than $350 million. Favorite causes include the promotion of Canadian culture, Jewish community and connection to Israel. He is one of the main benefactors of Taglit-Birthright Israel, which sends Jewish youth from North America on free educational tours of Israel. Bronfman's son, Stephen, now runs Claridge, the Montreal-based private investment firm founded by Charles in 1987.
