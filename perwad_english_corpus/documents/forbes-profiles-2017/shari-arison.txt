			Israel's richest woman, Shari Arison inherited the basis of her fortune from her father Ted, who founded cruise ship line Carnival Corp. Her minority slice of Carnival Corp. remains her largest asset. She also holds stakes in Israel's Bank Hapoalim and infrastructure firm Shikun & Binui Holdings.  She controls her investments through the Arison Group and runs the Ted Arison Family Foundation, which each year contributes to nonprofits involved in health, education, disabilities and research. The Tel Aviv resident has positioned herself as a force for good in business, investing in a number of environmentally-conscious projects, including a desalination plant, a "green" shopping mall in Israel and a $100 million venture dedicated to maximizing the efficiency of large urban water systems. She also launched International Good Deeds Day to advocate community service, creating a website and network called Goodnet.org that she says has connected some 6 million people around the world. In 2015, she released her fourth book, "The Doing Good Model." In 2016, she received the annual Medal of Light from Israel's parliament for her work with Holocaust survivors through the Ted Arison Family Foundation.
