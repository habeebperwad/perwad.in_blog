			With brothers Mathias and Peter, Jonas Kamprad inherited the fortune and responsibility that had been held by his father, Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad, until 2013.  Ikea's founder ranked among the top 10 richest people in the world for five years thanks to Forbes' estimate of the global furniture giant, but his net worth took a drastic slide in 2011 after his lawyers produced documents proving that he had irrevocably transferred the majority of his stake in Ikea to entities beyond his economic control decades earlier.  The three brothers still own Ikano Group, which originally was created to manage Ikea's real estate, insurance and financial service businesses, but was spun off as a separate company in 1988. Today Ikano Group is a $7.3 billion (annual sales) company that operates across Europe and Asia with interest in banking, real estate and shopping centers. Jonas, the middle child, studied industrial and furniture design in Switzerland, and applied his skills in Ikea-run subsidiary Habitat. He is a board member of Netherlands-based Ikea parent Stichting INGKA Foundation and Ikano Group.
