			Rudolf Maag, the son of a butcher, built a fortune in medical devices. He got an M.B.A. from Insead in 1973 and began working his way up the corporate ladder at pharmaceutical company Sandoz AG of Switzerland.  Eventually he moved to dental giant Straumann, where in 1990 he bought out the company's medical device division and later took it public as Stratec Medical. In 1999 he merged Stratec with Swiss medical device powerhouse Synthes and built up a 15% stake in the company, which was later sold to Johnson & Johnson. His most valuable stake is in Swiss pharma company Actelion, which is set to also be acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2017. Maag bought the luxurious Bellevue Hotel in 2012 with his son-in-law from fellow Swiss billionaire Thomas Straumann, an heir to the company where Maag served as an executive a quarter century earlier.
