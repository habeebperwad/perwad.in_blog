			Brian Chesky cofounded peer-to-peer room and home rental company Airbnb in 2008. A former bodybuilder, Chesky attended the Rhode Island School of Design with Joe Gebbia before the two started what was then Airbedandbreakfast. com in San Francisco with Nathan Blecharczyk. More than 60 million people have used the rental service, which operates in 34,000 cities in more than 190 countries. In September 2016, the company raised $555 million at a $30 billion valuation, part of a reported $850 million funding round. That same month, it took steps to curb bias among rental hosts, including asking them to sign a new nondiscrimination policy. Chesky has been focusing on Airbnb Trips, a platform launched in November 2016 that goes beyond accommodation to offer travel experiences. In May 2015, the Obama Administration named Chesky a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship.
