			Two years after he stepped down from the helm of insurance giant Aon, Patrick Ryan came out of retirement to set up Ryan Specialty Group, a wholesale brokerage and specialty insurance firm. Ryan began his first insurance venture in 1964, just a few years after he graduated from Northwestern University business school.  That firm merged with Combined International in 1982; Ryan became CEO of the new entity,  which he named the new entity Aon. He led Aon to become the world's largest reinsurance broker.  Ryan Specialty Group has expanded through acquisitions. A sports enthusiast, Ryan led Chicago's failed bid for the 2016 Olympic Games and is a minority shareholder of the Chicago Bears NFL team. He has also funded renovations of athletic facilities and scholarships for low-income students at Northwestern University.
