			Douglas was born a nobleman but without exceptional riches. After his first semester at Harvard Business School, he placed a bet on Volvo, buying 500 shares with the last of his savings and then borrowed against those holdings to pay the rest of the tuition.  After business school he returned to Sweden and set out on a managerial consulting career that eventually led him to run state-owned TV channel SVT2. He was CEO of the Dagens Nyheter, Sweden's largest newspaper company and later led the film company, SF. He was forced to leave in 1980 -- the chairman believed his private investments in real estate posed a conflict of interest. In 1985 Douglas acquired a controlling stake in Swedish security firm Securitas, which he and fellow billionaire Melker Sch√∂rling turned into a global powerhouse. Today, Douglas and his family are the largest shareholders in Investment AB Latour and has interests in the world's largest producer of locks and one of the leading European light fixtures manufacturers. Douglas' two billionaire sons, Carl and Eric, sit on the board of both Investment AB Latour and several of the companies within the company's sphere. The Douglas family is among Sweden's largest private landowners.
