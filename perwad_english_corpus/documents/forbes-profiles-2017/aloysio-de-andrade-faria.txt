			Aloysio de Andrade Faria's conglomerate Banco Alfa runs the gamut from finance to palm oil production to hotels and resorts to water brand to insurance to ice cream maker. Trained as a doctor, Faria only practiced medicine for two years before his father died and he took the helm of the family's Banco Real, transforming it into one of the largest banks in Brazil.  In 1998 he sold the institution to Dutch bank ABN Amro for $2.1 billion. He's since used some of the proceeds to expand into 15 other holdings, including Agropalma, Latin America's largest palm oil producer and hotel chain Transamerica, which operates one of Brazil's most exclusive resorts at Comandatuba Island. Faria has reportedly been focusing on succession planning over the last few year -- he has five daughters. He reportedly owns 150 pure-bred horses and is a voracious reader.
