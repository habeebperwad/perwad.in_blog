			Alicia Koplowitz inherited a stake in one of Spain's largest construction companies, Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, from her late father. In 1997 she sold her share to her older sister Esther, for $800 million.  Back in the 1960s, Alicia married Alberto Cortina, six months after Esther had married Cortina's cousin, Alberto Alcocer. "Los Albertos," as the Spanish press called them, ran FCC until both marriages ended in 1989 and the sisters took over. Alicia had three sons with Cortina. After selling her FCC stake, she diversified her investments and has seen her fortune grow steadily. Over the years she's invested in steelmaker Acerinox, electric utility Iberdrola and Banco Sabadell. She also has a stake in Hospes, a chain of luxury hotels in Spain, and owns hotels in Italy and Miami, along with real estate in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. Through her charitable foundation she sends Spanish fellows to study child psychiatry in England and the U.S. at places like Columbia University's Medical Center.
