			Dmitry Kamenshchik owns Moscow's Domodedovo Airport, the largest in Eastern Europe, serving an estimated 28.5 million passengers in 2016. He got into the business in 1992, when the then philosophy student at Moscow University chartered a plane to fly goods from China to Moscow.  He later built a cargo terminal and eventually took control of the entire airport. A deadly terrorist attack on Domodedovo in 2011 led to allegations against Kamenshchik but the criminal case closed in 2016, and the Prosecutor General's office declared the persecution of the businessman illegal.
