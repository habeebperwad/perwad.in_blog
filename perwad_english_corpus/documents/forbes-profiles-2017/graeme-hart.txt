			New Zealand's perennial richest person, Graeme Hart accumulated a packaging empire using leveraged buyouts to acquire under-performing businesses that make everyday products like milk cartons, water bottles, paper and foil.  Since 2013, his Rank Group has been selling off subsidiaries in an apparent move to pay down its debts. In December 2014, he unloaded Carter Holt Harvey's pulp, paper and packaging business to two Japanese firms for approximately $770 million. The following March his Reynolds Group Holdings, best known for its aluminum foil Reynolds Wrap, closed the $4.1 billion sale of subsidiary SIG, maker of cartons for beverage brands including V8, Ocean Spray, Dole, and others. The buyer was Canadian billionaire Gerald Schwartz' Onex Group.
