			Jim Jannard's second startup, RED Digital Camera, has become a favorite of directors from James Cameron (Avatar) to Ridley Scott (The Martian) to Peter Jackson (The Lord of The Rings, The Hobbit). Now this Hollywood darling is about to bet it can next take on the world of augmented and virtual reality.  Jannard is mum on details but promises it will be far bigger than anything he's ever done. His first fortune came from sunglass brand Oakley, which he started out of his car in 1975. He took the company public in 1995 and sold it to Luxottica for $2.1 billion. A University of Southern California dropout, he lives in Seattle and recently opened up a resort on a Fijian Island.
