			Sybill Storz is managing director of Karl Storz GmbH & Co. KG. Her father, Karl Storz, founded his company in 1945, as a manufacturer ear, nose & throat medical instruments, headlamps and binocular loupes.  Fascinated with developing instruments that would enable physicians to look inside the body, he pioneered the principle of "cold light illumination" whereby bright light generated by an external source is introduced into the body through a flexible fiber-optic cable. This innovation paved the way for modern endoscopy and laid the foundation for the future success of the company. When Karl died in 1996, his daughter Sybill took over and built on his legacy. Today, with a portfolio of more than 15,000 products, the company is a world leader in endoscopy instruments for human and veterinary medicine as well as industrial applications. With annual revenue of around $1.5 billion, Storz employs more than 6,700 people in 41 countries worldwide. Sybill owns 44.5% of the company, which is privately held. Her son Karl-Christian Storz is a board member.
