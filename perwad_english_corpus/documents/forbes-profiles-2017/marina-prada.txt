			Along with their famous sister, Marina Prada and her brother Alberto inherited stakes in the family business founded by their grandfather in 1913. Considered fashion royalty, Miuccia Prada is the co-CEO and lead designer of the handbag and fashion empire Prada.  Alberto and Marina each hold an estimated 12% stake in the company, which they inherited in 1977. Their sister Miuccia met Patrizio Bertelli, who ran a luxury leather company, at a Milan trade show in 1977 and signed him on as a contractor. A year later, they were married and Bertelli joined the company, taking care of the business side of things while pushing Prada into new directions. (His stake in the company also makes him a billionaire.) In 1986 Prada opened its first store in New York and expanded beyond high-end suitcases, handbags, and steamer trunks. A few years later, they unveiled a ready-to-wear women's collection and a lower-end brand, Miu Miu. In 2011, Miuccia and Bertelli took the company public in Hong Kong; the family remains firmly in control. Marina Prada is not involved in running the business.
