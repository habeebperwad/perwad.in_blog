			Denise York owns an estimated 90% of the San Francisco 49ers football team, the value of which increased following the 2014 opening of a new $1.2 billion stadium 40 miles south of San Francisco in the city of Santa Clara.  FORBES values the team at $3 billion. York's father, Edward Debartolo Sr. (d. 1994), built a fortune in shopping malls and bought the team for $13 million in 1977. York took control of the 49ers in 2000 from her brother, Edward Jr., who had controlled the team for 23 years.
