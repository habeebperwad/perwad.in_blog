			John Fisher, the youngest of Gap founders Doris and Donald (d. 2009) Fisher's three sons, keeps a low profile despite owning some well known sports teams. He is the majority owner of baseball's Oakland A's, and holds smaller stakes in Major League Soccer's San Jose Earthquakes and the Scottish Glasgow Celtic football club.  A's co-owner Lew Wolff is the public face of the team. John is the only one of his brothers who does not sit on Gap's board, but instead manages his family's investments as president of Pisces Inc. He is also the founder of investment firm Sansome Partners and chairs the board of the KIPP Foundation, which trains and funds teachers for the KIPP public charter school network.
