			Luig Rovati's fortune stems from Rottapharm, a specialty drug maker based in the northern Italian city of Monza that was purchased by Swedish pharmaceutical firm Meda for $3.1 billion in cash and stock in 2014. Two years later, Meda was acquired by U. S. pharma company Mylan for $7.2 billion in cash and stock. Luigi Rovati is no longer involved with the company. He founded Rottapharm as an independent research lab in 1961. His son Luca is CEO of the family's holding company, Fidim, while his son Lucio is its chairman.
