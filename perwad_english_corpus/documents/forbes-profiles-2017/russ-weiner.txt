			Russ Weiner runs Rockstar, the energy drink company he founded in 2001. Though Weiner struck gold by marketing an energy drink in a tall-boy can, Rockstar remains a distant competitor to the other two billionaire-run energy drink brands, Monster and Red Bull.  One reason Weiner might be stuck in third place: He spends less on marketing than competitors and chooses to sponsor music festivals and low-tier extreme sports rather than purchase traditional ads. The son of right-wing talk-radio star Michael Savage, Weiner unsuccessfully ran for California State Assembly in 1998 and remains interested in politics, telling Forbes that America needs "a leader who is going to protect the borders, language [and] culture of America."
