			Anas Sefrioui, head of publicly traded homebuilder Groupe Addoha, enjoyed a long run winning government contracts to develop low-cost housing in Morocco, but government cutbacks and a real estate slump hurt Addoha in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, the company embarked on a plan to pay down debt, cut costs and focus on selling existing inventory.  The company is on track to achieve its goals ahead of schedule, sending the stock back up in late 2016. His daughter Kenza is the company's vice president.
