			Russian immigrant Igor Olenicoff has built up a substantial real estate empire in the U.S. and has also spent a good deal of time dealing with lawsuits.  In July 2015, a Superior Court judge in Orange County, California ruled in favor of Olenicoff in a suit brought by his former bank, UBS AG.  The judge dismissed the Swiss bank's claims of malicious prosecution by Olenicoff and his Olen Properties, saying in essence that UBS itself was too dirty to sue. Olenicoff has been in dispute with UBS since 2007, when he pleaded guilty to a felony tax charge for lying about stashing more than $350 million offshore (in Europe). He paid $52 million in back taxes and was sentenced to 2 years of probation and 120 hours of community service. Olenicoff then sued UBS, which he claimed had mismanaged his investments and misled him into evading taxes, but the case was thrown out in 2012. Outside of the courts, Olenicoff continues to run his real estate firm. Olen Properties purchased 860 apartments in Mesa, Arizona during the summer of 2015. The company owns 8 million square feet of office space and 11,000 residential units across California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona.
