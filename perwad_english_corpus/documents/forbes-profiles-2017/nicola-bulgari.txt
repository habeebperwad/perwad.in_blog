Their nephew Francesco Trapani was the longtime CEO.  In 2011, with Bulgari established as a global luxury brand behind not only jewelry but also watches, fragrances, apparel, hotels and resorts, the family sold its controlling stake to French billionaire Bernard Arnault's luxury goods giant LVMH for $5.2 billion in cash and stock. Bulgari is also well known for his impressive car collection, housed in Rome and Allentown, Pennsylvania, which includes mostly American cars from 1920s to the 1940s. Bulgari built a 21-acre complex in Allentown with seven warehouses and four restoration shops, home to roughly 125 cars.
