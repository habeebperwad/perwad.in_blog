			Bernd Freier opened his first clothing store in Wuerzburg, Germany in 1969. He named it 'Sir Oliver' after the hero of Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. The company's name has since been shortened to s. Oliver. The first store outside Germany opened in 1998, in Austria. With annual sales of around $1.8 billion, the company now has more than 700 stores and partner stores in over 20 countries. It has diversified beyond standard mix-and-match casual fare to include underwear, beachwear and nightwear, as well as licensing programs (eyewear, fragrances, shoes, watches, etc.) and sub-labels encompassing evening wear (s.Oliver Premium) and trend-focused collections (s.Oliver Denim). Freier stepped down as CEO in January 2014, but he still serves as chairman of the advisory board.
