			Gustav Magnar Witzoe, 23, owns 47% of Salmar ASA's equity, which was gifted to him in 2013 by his father Gustav Witzoe. The Norwegian salmon producer, one of the world's largest, was founded by the elder Witzoe in 1991. Salmar has led the industrialization of fish farming in Norway, refining the product that before primarily had been exported as gutted and frozen into a more sophisticated cuts with higher margins.  Fish farming is now one of Norway's biggest industries. Witzoe's father still runs the company. The younger Witzoe, meanwhile, is trying to make his own mark investing in real estate and as a tech start-up investor.
