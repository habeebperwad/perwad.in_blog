			Peter Gilgan is one of Canada's biggest homebuilders. His Mattamy Homes has counted more than 70,000 homeowners as customers since he founded the company in 1978. Inspired by the New Urbanism movement, Gilgan set out to build suburban dwellings that broke from the bland and impersonal developments he saw popping up around Canada at the time.  Mattamy (named after the two oldest of his eight children, Matt and Amy) began designing and building entire planned communities from the ground up in 1986. Gilgan remains CEO and is making a big push to expand his U.S. operations. In 2012 Gilgan pledged $40 million to help build the Peter Gilgan Centre of Research at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and in 2014 he donated $30 million to Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital for a 17-story patient care tower.
