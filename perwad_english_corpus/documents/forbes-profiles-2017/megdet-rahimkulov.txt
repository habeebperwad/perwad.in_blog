			Megdet Rahimkulov has been a fastidious investor who until recently ran his own diversified investment portfolio.  Now his assets are managed by his company in Cyprus. In the mid-1990s he became chief executive and 10% owner of a joint venture between gas giant Gazprom and Hungary's oil and gas concern MOL.  He also headed AEB, a Hungarian bank that Gazprom bought to process payments from its local customers, and later bought it from Gazprom. In 2007 he sold the bank and used the proceeds to buy shares in MOL and OTP, Hungary's largest bank. He also owns shares in Gazprom and VTB.
