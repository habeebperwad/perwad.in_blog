			Ukrainian-born oil baron Viktor Vekselberg studied at the Moscow Institute of Railroad Engineering in the 1970s. He made his first million selling scrap copper from worn-out cables. He led Russia's first successful hostile takeover in 1994, when his Renova  firm took control of the Vladimir Tractor Factory and installed a Russian-born Harvard M. B.A. to run it. He later bought several medium-size aluminum smelters and bauxite mines, united them into $1 billion (sales) Sual Holding in 1996. That group eventually became part of one of the world's largest aluminum producers, UC Rusal, in which he still has a stake.  Vekselberg got $7 billion in cash when he and his partners sold their 50% stake in joint oil venture TNK-BP to state-owned Rosneft in 2013. He invested some of the proceeds into companies like Swiss industrial firms Sulzer and Oerlikon, Swiss steel company Schmolz+Bickenbach and Italian firm Octo Telematics, which makes software for insurance companies. Vekselberg owns a large art collection, including nine Faberge eggs he bought from the Forbes family for $100 million.
