			Legendary cofounder of Indian tech giant Infosys, N.R.Narayana Murthy caused a stir recently by flagging concerns over deteriorating corporate governance standards at the firm and calling for an overhaul of its board.  These relate to high severance amounts paid to departing executives, including a former CFO, as well as a huge pay rise to the CEO, the first non-founder to run the software services provider since 2014.  Murthy praised the demonetisation of 86% of India's rupees last November calling it a 'masterstroke' that would root out corruption. The Infosys Foundation, overseen by wife Sudha, is setting up the Infosys Institute of Robotic Surgery in Bangalore with health care firm Narayana Hrudalaya.
