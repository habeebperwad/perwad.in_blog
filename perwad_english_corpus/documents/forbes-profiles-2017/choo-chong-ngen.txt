			Media-shy hotel tycoon Choo Chong Ngen, who made his early fortune with his budget Hotel 81 chain in Singapore, is now fast expanding with other mid-tier brands. In 2016 he opened the 1,500-room Hotel Boss in Singapore.  He also owns other brands like V Hotel, Venue Hotel and Value Hotel. His privately held hotel empire, which daughter Carolyn has been helping him run since 2002, has more than 6,000 rooms across the island. Choo got his start in textiles before he latched on to property development and then hotels.
