			Siblings Kuldip and Gurbachan Singh Dhingra are the fourth generation in a family of paintmakers and get their wealth from a 75% stake in Kolkata-headquartered Berger Paints India. Family's paint business extends back to their grandfather and great grandfather who started a paint shop in 1898 in Amritsar, Punjab.  Their father began making paints but sold the business. The brothers restarted what was then called UK Paints in the 1960s and later made profitable paint exports to the former Soviet Union. In 1991 they bought Berger Paints, then the country's smallest player. Two of their children sit on Berger's board and are being groomed to succeed.
