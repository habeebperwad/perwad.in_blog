			Ilona Herlin is a great-granddaughter of Finnish business legend Harald Herlin, who invested in Kone Elevators in 1924. After her father's death in 2003, Ilona and her siblings Ilkka and Niklas discovered their father had rewritten the will in 1999 and left most of the ownership in Kone to their brother Antti.  Angered that they had never been informed, the siblings battled for control. The dispute ended in 2005, with Kone being demerged. Antti maintained control over the core elevator business and received a majority stake in Kone, while the other siblings were given a majority stake in Cargotec, which produces machinery that handles heavy duty cargo for ships and ports, and a minority stake in Kone. Four of the five siblings are billionaires.
