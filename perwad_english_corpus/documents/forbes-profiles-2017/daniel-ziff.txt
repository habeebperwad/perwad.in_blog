			Daniel, the youngest billionaire Ziff brother, is now on his own. In the biggest family shake up since he and his two brothers started investing together in the 1990s, each of the three is now independently managing his own portion of the family's vast riches.  For years they had jointly poured money into high-profile hedge funds through Ziff Brothers Investments. After shuttering their hedge funds in 2014, billionaire brothers Dirk, Daniel and Robert have kept quiet about where their money is going, although reports say some of it is now invested with former employees of their hedge funds. The roots of the Ziff fortune date back to 1927 when Daniel's grandfather William Sr. first started his publishing business. His father William Jr. built up Ziff Davis, which became best known for such trade publications as PC Magazine and Car and Driver, before selling it for $1.4 billion in 1994. The brothers have since increased those proceeds tenfold.
