			Donald Trump became the first billionaire president in U.S. history in January 2017, but the business that made him rich remains intact. Today his sons Eric and Donald Jr. run the day-to-day operations. They have promised to separate the Trump Organization from the Trump presidency, but it's unclear whether that is actually happening.  The president created a trust to park his properties -- which include office towers, private golf clubs and luxury hotels -- and Eric Trump told Forbes he will update his father on their financials "probably quarterly." Although the Trump name now extends around the world, the core of the president's fortune remains tied to a handful of buildings in midtown Manhattan in New York City. He got his start working with his father Fred, who developed low-cost housing in Brooklyn and Queens.
