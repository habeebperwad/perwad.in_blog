			Chase Coleman started out as a hedge fund investor, but his Tiger Global Management has evolved into a tech-focused investment firm that specializes in making bets on both publicly-traded and private companies through its hedge funds and venture funds.  His Tiger Global hedge fund, which has a long track record of delivering fantastic returns, hit a rough stretch in 2016, posting losses of 15%. Coleman worked for hedge fund legend Julian Robertson before starting his own firm. He has two long-time partners, Scott Shleifer, who helps run the Tiger Global hedge fund, and Lee Fixel, who oversees Tiger Global's venture funds.
