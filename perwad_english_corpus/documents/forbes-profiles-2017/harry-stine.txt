			Farm boy turned seed-genetics savant Harry Stine has become the richest man in Iowa licensing his corn and soybean seed genetics to multinational firms like Monsanto and Syngenta. His current obsession is tinkering with seed genetics that allow for better yields or to make them pesticide resistant.  An experiment with corn in 2015 led farmers to plant over 140,000 acres where specially bred seeds were densely planted to get higher output. Son of a hardscrabble farmer, Stine's fascination with seeds dates to when he was a farm boy. He made his first foray into the seed breeding business in the 1960s and quietly built his empire on the back of highly lucrative licensing deals that he negotiated in the 1990s with large multinational corporations across the globe. Dyslexic and mildly autistic, but a math and data wiz, Stine is an astute businessman and a formidable negotiator. He owns a small home not far from the Stine Seeds headquarters in Adel, Iowa that he drives to in his Ford F-150 pickup truck and where is four children also work. He's an avid table tennis player and enjoys hunting morel mushrooms. He donates to his alma mater, McPherson College in Kansas, as well as to the Mayo Clinic.
