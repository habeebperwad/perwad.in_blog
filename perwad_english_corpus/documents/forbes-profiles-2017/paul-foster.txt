			As a teenager Paul Foster got his start in the oil fields, welding pipees, digging ditches, cleaning tanks. He has called that labor "the single biggest motivation to get an education." The Baylor graduate became a CPA handling the books for small oil refineries across the Southwest.  Then in 1997 he founded Western Refining and took it public in 2006. The company operates two plants that process 150,000 barrels per day and owns 200 filling stations. Western in late 2015 agreed to acquire rival refiner Northern Tier Energy. Foster is part owner of MountainStar Sports, which owns Triple-A baseball team the El Paso Chihuahuas.
