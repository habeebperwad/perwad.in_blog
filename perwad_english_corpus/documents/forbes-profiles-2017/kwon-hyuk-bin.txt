			Kwon Hyuk-Bin founded Smilegate in 2002 and has built it into one of the most successful gaming companies in South Korea. Following a partnership that started in 2008 with Chinese Internet giant Tencent, it released its most popular title, CrossFire, which generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2013. Kwon's Smilegate Holdings, of which he owns 100%, became the largest shareholder of Korean mobile game developer SundayToz the following year.  Also in 2014, Kwon launched an ambitious start-up incubation initiative called Orange Farm, which has grown to become the largest program of its kind in Korea run by a private company. Orange Farm aims to leverage Smilegate's business network to help participating entrepreneurs obtain capital and implement marketing plans.
