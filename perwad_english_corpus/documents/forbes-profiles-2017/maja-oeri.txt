			A descendant of Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, founder of Switzerland-based pharma behemoth Roche, Maja Oeri joined the Forbes billionaires ranks in 2013 after pulling her 5% stake in the company out of the family pool in 2011. At the time, Oeri reportedly said there was no bad blood between her and other family members; however, the move diminished the family's majority control in the maker of blockbuster drugs like Tamiflu and Valium.  An art enthusiast, Oeri runs the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation and is a trustee of the Modern Museum of Art. In 1999, Oeri and her husband established the Laurenz Foundation in memory of their first born son, Laurenz Jakob, who died an untimely death. The foundation seeks to promote and support the fine arts.
