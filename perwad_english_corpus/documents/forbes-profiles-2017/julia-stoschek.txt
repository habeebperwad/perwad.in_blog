			Art collector Julia Stoschek is the daughter of Michael Stoschek, who heads up the family's autoparts company, Brose. She owns an estimated 20% of the company. Her father is the grandson of Max Brose, founder of the namesake German auto-parts maker.  Michael Stoschek took over the company in 1971 at age 23. Under his leadership, Brose evolved from being a national manufacturer into a world market leader in electrical and mechanical components and integrated systems that are largely invisible to vehicle drivers.  Brose calls itself the world's fifth-largest family-owned automotive supplier. Approximately 24,000 employees work for the company at 60 locations in 23 countries. Annual revenues top $6.4 billion. Julia has become a well-known name in the art world, with collection focused on time-based video art. Her collection includes some 700 works of digital and time-based-media art from the 1960s onwards. She is on the board of directors of MoMA PS1, a contemporary art exhibition space that is an affiliate of New York's Museum of Modern Art.
