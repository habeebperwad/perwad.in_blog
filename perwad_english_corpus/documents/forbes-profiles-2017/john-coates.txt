			John Coates is co-CEO of Bet365, one of the world's largest online gambling companies, with $45 billion in bets placed in the year through March 2016. Coates studied law at Bristol University and started his career as an attorney.  In 2001, his billionaire sister and co-CEO, Denise, convinced him to join her in launching Bet365 after she'd sold some of their father's betting shops to bookmaker Coral. John owns a quarter of the company. In July 2015, he became vice chairman of the Stoke City Football Club, in which Bet365 owns a majority stake. That same year, Bet365 moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its favorable regulations. Coates lives near Stoke-On-Trent with his wife and two children.
