			Gerald Schwartz runs Onex, one of Canada's largest private equity firms. He cut his teeth working with buyout legends Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George Roberts at Bear Stearns in the 1970s. After the Americans left to start KKR in 1976, Schwartz went home to Canada and cofounded the media company CanWest.  Six years later he started Onex, where he has quietly outperformed many of the vaunted American private equity shops. As chairman and CEO he manages Onex's $23 billion in assets. An honorary director at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Schwartz also serves as a director of bookstore chain Indigo Books & Music, which his wife, Heather Reisman, founded and continues to run. The couple owns homes in Toronto, Malibu, Nantucket and Palm Beach. Their HESEG Foundation provides full academic scholarships and living expenses to lone soldiers who travel to Israel to serve in the Israel Defense Forces.
