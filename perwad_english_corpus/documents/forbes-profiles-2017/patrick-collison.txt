			Stripe cofounder and CEO Patrick Collison has changed the way the world pays for goods and services. His 550-person company lets businesses and individuals easily accept payments over the internet, and now processes billions of dollars in transactions per year in 25 different countries.  Collison, an MIT grad, launched Stripe with his brother John in 2010. The company raised $150 million at a $9.2 billion valuation in November 2016, turning the two twenty-somethings into billionaires. This isn't the first time the brothers have worked together. They previously founded Auctomatic, which helped manage transactions for sellers on sites like Amazon and eBay. It was acquired by Live Current Media in 2008 for $5 million, in a transaction that made the then teenagers millionaires. Patrick, who now lives in San Francisco, CA, was born and raised in the countryside near Limerick, Ireland, where his parents ran a lakeside hotel. He and John both took up coding as kids, competing against each other to master the craft.
