			Russia's youngest billionaire, Kirill Shamalov, a former economic advisor to the Russian government, is married to President Vladimir Putin's daughter, academic Katerina Tikhonova, according to sources. Officials refuse to confirm the marriage or that she is Putin's daughter.  The son of Rossiya Bank shareholder Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime friend of Putin, Shamalov studied law at Saint Petersburg State University and became vice president of Sibur at age 26. In 2014, he bought a stake in Sibur from billionaire Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin's who was the target of U.S. sanctions. He is now the second-largest shareholder in petrochemical giant Sibur.
