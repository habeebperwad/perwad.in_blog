			Ann Walton Kroenke is the daughter of Wal-Mart cofounder Bud Walton, the brother of Sam Walton. She inherited part of Bud's stake in the retailer when he died in 1995. A registered nurse, Ann is not involved in Wal-Mart as a board member or an executive.  She is married to Stan Kroenke, who is also a billionaire thanks to his ownership of millions of square feet of commercial real estate -- much of it shopping plazas near Wal-Mart stores. The Kroenkes also own the Los Angeles Rams, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Rapids and a majority stake in soccer club Arsenal.
