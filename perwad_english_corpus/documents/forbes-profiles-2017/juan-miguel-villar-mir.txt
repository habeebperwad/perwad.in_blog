			Juan-Miguel Villar Mir controls the construction firm Obrascon Huarte Lain S.A. together with his children. The $5 billion (2015 revenues) giant trades on Madrid's stock exchange and builds roads, railways, ports and airports in 30 countries.  Separately from OHL, his privately-held Grupo Villar Mir is the largest independent producer of hydroelectric power in Spain, a major fertilizer producer, and a real estate developer. Its silicon producer Grupo FerroAtl√°ntica agreed to a $3.1 billion merger with Nasdaq-listed Globe Specialty Materials in 2015 to create Ferroglobe, currently Villar Mir's most valuable asset. Grupo Villar Mir also has smaller subsidiaries that trade, transport and distribute diesel oil, make pre-stressed, reinforced concrete, and produce children's clothes. In 2011 the King of Spain gave Villar Mir the title of "marquis."
