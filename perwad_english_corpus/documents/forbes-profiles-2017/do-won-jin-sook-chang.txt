			With little more than a high school education the young Korean couple came to the U.S. in 1981 in search for a better life. Husband Do Won, just 22 at the time, worked the morning shift at a coffee shop, pumped gas during the afternoon and started a small office cleaning business that kept him busy until midnight.  Jin Sook, 25, toiled as a hairdresser, a skill she acquired back in her home country. While at the gas station, Do Won noticed that wealthy men in the garment industry drove the nicest cars, inspiring him to take a job at a clothing store, where he was determined to learn the ropes. "I treated it like it was my own business," he told FORBES. After three years in the states, the couple pooled $11,000 in savings and opened a 900-square-foot apparel store in L.A. in 1984. Calling it Fashion 21, first year sales reached $700,000 and the couple expanded by opening a new store every six months; it later evolved into Forever 21. Today the privately held chain had $4.4 billion in 2015 sales from 790 locations across 48 countries.
