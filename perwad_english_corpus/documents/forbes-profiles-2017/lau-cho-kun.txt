			Lau Cho Kun's move to concentrate on real estate development has paid off handsomely. The share price of his Hap Seng Consolidated has been enjoying a steady upward trend, especially after news in 2016 of its joint venture with Naza TTDI, a township development specialist, to develop Met 5, which consists of residential blocks, offices and a 4-star hotel on an 8.95 acre plot.  With its plantation, fertilizer-trading and quarry-building-material divisions, he continues to cope with rising costs and weaker global demand. Also in 2016 the company consolidated its profitable commercial vehicles business into its Hong Kong-based holding entity, Lei Shing Hong, citing its proximity to the Chinese market and less exposure to currency fluctuation.
