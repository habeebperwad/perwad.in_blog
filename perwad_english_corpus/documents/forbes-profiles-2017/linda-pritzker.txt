			Linda Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, has steered clear of working in her family's enterprises and devoted herself to Tibetan Buddhist practices. She was one of the first U.S. women to be ordained as a Lama in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and in April 2016 published a Westerner's guide to Tibetan Buddhist meditation with an introductory letter from H. H. Dalai Lama. Her fortune originates from the family's stake in hotel chain Hyatt and proceeds from the sale of conglomerate Marmon to Berkshire Hathaway, which paid $4.8 billion for a 64% stake in 2008. Her grandfather A.N. Pritzker (d. 1986), with his sons Jay (d. 1999), Robert (her father; d. 2011) and Donald (d. 1972), created Chicago-based industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings and hotel chain Hyatt. She is an occasional donor to liberal causes and is building a Tibetan Buddhist retreat center in rural Montana.
