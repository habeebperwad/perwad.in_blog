			Forrest Preston made a fortune capitalizing on America's aging population. His privately held Life Care Centers of America brought in an estimated $3 billion in 2015 revenue from nursing homes, assisted living facilities and retirement living communities in 28 states.  He founded the business in 1970 and remains its sole owner. In October 2016, the company agreed to pay $145 million to settle a government lawsuit alleging that the firm had knowingly over-billed Medicare and another federal healthcare program. The litigation stemmed from whisteblower complaints filed by two former Life Care employees in 2008. The has company denied any wrongdoing. Preston also has a stake in Luken Communications, owner of seven broadcast networks, which exited bankruptcy in October 2014. Preston lives in Cleveland, Tenn., where Life Care is based.
