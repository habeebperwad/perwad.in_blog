			A lesser-known Berkshire Hathaway billionaire, Stewart Horejsi began buying up stock in the conglomerate for as little as $265 per share shortly after reading in John Train's "The Money Masters" in 1980. He attended board meetings when they were fewer than a dozen people sitting in in folding chairs; now Berkshire's class A stock, worth six figures per share, is the most expensive in the world.  Horejsi (pronounced hor-ish) still holds some of those shares, but has also put hundreds of millions of dollars from previous Berkshire stock sales into a closed-end mutual fund, Boulder Growth & Income Fund. After graduating from the University of Kansas, Horejsi had ambitions of heading to Wall Street. Instead he went home to Salina, Kansas to help with his father's company -- a distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases -- though he spent much of his life managing his family's investments as well. He still advises the Boulder fund, of which the Horejsi family owns more than 40%. He and his wife, Ellen, split time between homes in Arizona, Oregon and Barbados, where he purchased an 18th-century plantation beach house formerly owned by Claudette Colbert.
