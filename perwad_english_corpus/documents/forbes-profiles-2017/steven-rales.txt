			Danaher Corp., the industrial conglomerate controlled by Steven and brother Mitchell, also a billionaire, spun out industrial product maker Fortive in July 2016. Danaher kept many of its science and technology businesses, including a unit that makes dental-care products.  The Rales brothers started building what would become Danaher in the 1980s, buying up companies the way speculators flip homes. Taking what they learned at their dad's real estate company, they jumped into the takeover game by focusing on tax avoidance and cash flow. They acquired their first company in 1981, a vinyl-siding manufacturer called Master Shield. It threw off enough cash to finance further acquisitions. One, in 1983, was a crippled REIT they renamed Danaher after a Montana stream where they once fished for trout. All told, they acquired more than three dozen companies, allowing Danaher to become a massive, if unstylish, firm with $20 billion in revenue. Their success has allowed Steven to pursue an interest in movie-making; his film-production company, Indian Paintbrush, has backed flicks like Wes Anderson's "Moonrise Kingdom" and "The Grand Budapest Hotel."
