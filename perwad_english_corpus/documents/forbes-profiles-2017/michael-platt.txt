			Highly leveraged bets on interest rates paid off for Platt in 2016 as his supersized family office turned in a 50% return net of costs. Platt co-founded BlueCrest Capital Management in late 2000 after nearly a decade at JP Morgan.  Platt grew BlueCrest into one of the world's largest hedge fund managers with more than $35 billion in assets at its peak, offering low-volatility funds marked by rapid trading across a wide variety of markets. A push into equities and poor results led to investor exits and he handed outside investors their money back in 2015, joining the likes of George Soros and Steve Cohen in running a family office that resembles a big hedge fund. Platt has more than 100 teams of professional traders managing money for his own account.
