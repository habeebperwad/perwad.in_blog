			The Milanese designer Stefano Gabbana is one half of Dolce & Gabbana, one of the world's most influential luxury fashion empires. The $1.2 billion (sales) design firm is headquartered in Milan, but also owns branches in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo.  Born in Milan to a worker in a printing factory and a mother who ironed clothes for a laundry service, Gabbana met Domenico Dolce at a club in the early 1980s, eventually landing a job with designer Giorgio Correggiari, where Dolce worked as an assistant designer. After a year designing clothes, closely tutored by Dolce, they left in 1983 and began to work as freelancers, eventually launching Dolce & Gabbana in 1985. The following year, they made their runway debut at the Milan Fashion Week. Their big break came when Madonna chose them to design the costumes for her Girlie tour in 1993. They put animal prints on the map, and are known for their flamboyant, extravagant style. Gabbana, who studied graphic design in high school but was never much of a student, and Dolce ended their romantic relationship in 2003 but still work together and jointly own one of the world's most powerful fashion brands, a private company.
