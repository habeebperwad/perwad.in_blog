			Back in 1965, Peter Buck, a physicist, lent the son of a family friend, Fred DeLuca, $1,000 to start a sub shop in Bridgeport, Conn. From there, DeLuca grew his sandwich business into Subway, today the world's largest restaurant chain.  DeLuca ran the company until his death in September 2015; his sister then took over. Subway's sales have slid in recent years, and it's been caught up in a nasty scandal involving its former spokesman, Jared Fogle, who pleaded guilty to child pornography charges in 2015. Buck still lives in Connecticut and still owns half the company.
