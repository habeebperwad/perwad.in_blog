			John Menard started his eponymous hardware store chain in 1958 with the humble intention of creating a pole building company. More than 50 years later, that business has mushroomed into a privately-held empire, Menard Inc. , which boasts annual revenues of nearly $9 billion. Menard, who still owns the vast majority of the company, has never taken his eye off of the details. He continues to monitor every aspect of his stores, from merchandise layouts to the mix of pavement used in the parking lots out front. He even insists that all employees, including his top executives, punch a time clock every morning. That meticulousness has clearly paid off -- the septuagenarian has held a spot on the Forbes Billionaires List for 16 straight years.
