			Francesco Caltagirone, known as Franco, is the most successful of an extended clan of Caltagirones who originally came from the Sicilian city of Palermo. Caltagirone's grandfather owned a construction company; his father moved to Rome with his family in the early 1900s to expand the family construction and real estate empire.  Caltagirone, an engineer by training who got his degree while working for the family business, took it to the next level. He owns more than 50% of industrial holding company Caltagirone SpA, which is publicly traded. Once in control of the Caltagirone Group, he expanded through acquisition, first acquiring a stake in construction firm Vianini dallo Ior in the 1980s. He also acquired a large stake in Cementir, a cement producer now run by his son Francesco Jr., and bought into utilities during the privatization of Acea, Italy's water and electricity distributor. He also built a media group now called Caltagirone Editore, Italy's second largest newspaper publisher, by buying several papers. In 2006, he was knighted "Cavaliere del Lavoro" for his contributions to Italian business.
