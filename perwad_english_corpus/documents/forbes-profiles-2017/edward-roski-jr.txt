			Los Angeles-based real estate developer Edward Roski Jr. continues to expand his portfolio of mainly industrial properties. His Majestic Realty Co. owns more than 76 million square feet of commercial real estate, primarily in the suburbs of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Denver.  The firm is also developing a 441-acre business park on the site of Pennsylvania's former Bethlehem Steel plant, with tenants including Crayola and Wal-Mart. Roski's father founded Majestic Realty in 1948. After he took over, Roski Jr. helped lead development of the Staples Center in downtown L.A. He's also a minority owner of the L.A. Kings hockey team and the L.A. Lakers basketball team. After losing a years-long battle to build a football stadium in Los Angeles, Roski's firm reportedly has partnered with billionaire Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands on a proposed football stadium for the Oakland Raiders in Las Vegas. Roski spent four years as a Marine Corps officer in Vietnam, earning two Purple Hearts. His outdoor pursuits include cycling across Russia and Burma. In April 2016, Roski and his wife, Gayle, announced a $25 million gift to endow an eye institute at the University of Southern California, where they met as undergraduates.
