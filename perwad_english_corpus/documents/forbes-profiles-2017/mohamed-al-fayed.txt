			Mohamed Al Fayed's Ritz hotel in Paris reopened in June 2016 after four years of renovation at a cost of $450 million. Suites are named after one-time guests, including Coco Chanel, F. Scott Fitzgerald and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.  In July 2013, Al Fayed sold Fulham Football Club to U.S. auto parts billionaire Shahid Khan for a reported $300 million. He bought the English soccer team in 1997 and took a small loss when he sold it. Al Fayed fared much better with 75 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, netting a profit when he sold his lease in December 2012. In 2010 Al Fayed, a London-based Egyptian businessman, sold Harrods department store to Qatar Holding for a reported $2.4 billion.
