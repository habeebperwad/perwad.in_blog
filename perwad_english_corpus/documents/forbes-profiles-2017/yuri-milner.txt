He sold those stakes but later invested in Spotify and Airbnb. He also bet big on Chinese tech companies, including online retailers Alibaba and JD. Com, and led multiple funding rounds in mobile phone maker Xiaomi. A former physicist, Milner joined Google's Sergey Brin and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg in 2012 to found the Breakthrough Prize, which rewards top scientists with lucrative prizes and a glitzy awards ceremony.  In July 2015, he launched "Breakthrough Listen," a $100 million project to search for alien life. "The biggest questions of our existence are at stake," he wrote in an open letter cosigned by eminent physicist Stephen Hawking, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and others.
