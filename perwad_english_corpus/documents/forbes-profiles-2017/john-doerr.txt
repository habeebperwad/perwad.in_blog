			After more than three decades at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, John Doerr moved into the chairman's seat in March 2016, saying he will play more of a coaching role.  The move came a year after he guided Kleiner Perkins through a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by former junior partner Ellen Pao, which was decided in the firm's favor. He started his career at Intel in the 1970s; while at Kleiner Perkins, he has led investments in tech hits Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Google and Amazon and more recently in Twitter and Coursera. Doerr and his wife Ann have signed The Giving Pledge, promising to give away at least half of their fortune to philanthropic causes.
