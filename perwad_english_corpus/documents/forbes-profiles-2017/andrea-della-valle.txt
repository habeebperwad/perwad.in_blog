			Andrea Della Valle and his brother, Diego, are billionaires thanks to their majority ownership of publicly-traded Italian luxury goods maker Tod's S.p.A. Founded by their grandfather in the early 1900s, Tod's is now a $1.1 billion (sales) producer of shoes and purses.  Andrea serves as its vice chairman (Diego is chairman). The brothers also own stakes in a number of Italian companies, including Vespa-maker Piaggio, investment bank Mediobanca and Florence's top soccer team, ACF Fiorentina. The club nearly ceased to exist after its previous owner drove it into bankruptcy, but the Della Valle brothers rescued the team and helped turn it around. Andrea served as Fiorentina's chairman until 2009.
