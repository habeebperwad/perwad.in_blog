			Carl Cook is the CEO of medical device giant Cook Group, which distributes catheters, pacemakers and other products to 135 countries. His parents started business in 1963 in the spare bedroom of their Bloomington, Indiana, apartment, and Carl took over as CEO after his father Bill died in 2011. According to Bob Hammel's 2008 biography, "Bill Cook Story," Carl's parents slowly transferred their fortune to their son to ensure the family's control of the business without burdening the company with high taxes.  Carl earned an MBA from the University of Iowa, then spent a year setting up the company's computers in France and Germany before working at the two of the company's plants.
