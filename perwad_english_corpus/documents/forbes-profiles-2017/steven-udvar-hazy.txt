			Steven Udvar-Hazy is credited with creating the airplane leasing industry. He is chairman of Air Lease Corp., which went public in 2011. It is Udvar-Hazy's second company in the airplane leasing industry.  His first, International Lease Finance Corp., was sold to AIG in 1990 for $1.3 billion. Air Lease competes directly with AIG's airplane leasing business. In April 2015, Air Lease announced that it would pay $72 million to AIG to settle a lawsuit in which AIG alleged that Air Lease employees took trade secrets. Air Lease did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement agreement. Udvar-Hazy immigrated to New York from Budapest, Hungary as a child. A certified jet pilot, he attended UCLA. After graduating, Udvar-Hazy started his own California commuter airline, but struggled to stay in the black. He realized that the money was in leasing airplanes to airlines. He's given about $100 million to Stanford University, where his children went to college, and is also the namesake of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, to which he donated $66 million.
