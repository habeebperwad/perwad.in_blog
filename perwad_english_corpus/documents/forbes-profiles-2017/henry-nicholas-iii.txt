			Henry Nicholas III cofounded fabless semiconductor firm Broadcom in 1991 from a spare bedroom in a Redondo Beach, Calif., condominium with business partner Henry Samueli and helped turn it into an $8.4 billion (revenues) success.  In February 2016 Broadcom was acquired by Singapore-based chip firm Avago for $37 billion in cash and stock; the new firm is called Broadcom Ltd. Nicholas retired from Broadcom in 2003 but has held onto a 4% stake in the company. A music enthusiast, Nicholas says his inspiration for Broadcom came from Pink Floyd lyrics. He is now focused on philanthropy. His Nicholas Academic Centers have sent more than 230 students to top-ranked universities across the nation. Through his Henry T. Nicholas Foundation, he frequently gives to Episcopal community causes as well as to arts and education programs. In 2008 he mobilized California to pass Marsy's Law, a crime victim's bill of rights, named for his murdered sister.
