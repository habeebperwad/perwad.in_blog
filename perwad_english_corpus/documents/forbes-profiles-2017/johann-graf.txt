			Johan Graf is the owner of Novomatic Group, one of the largest integrated conglomerates in the international gaming industry. The $2 billion (sales) company has offices in more than 43 countries and exports gaming equipment to more than 80 countries.  Raised by his grandparents in a one-room flat with no running water and a shared bathroom, he apprenticed as a butcher and was expected to take over his family's butcher shop. Instead Graf began importing American pinball machines to Austria via Belgium, then became an agent for a British slot machine company. When electronic machines came on the scene, he found a niche as a servicing specialist, hiring qualified technicians. In 1980, he founded Novomatic Automatenhandels AG, which introduced the Admiral line of gaming machines. Graf quickly extended his geographic reach, entering the Swiss market in 1982 and the East Bloc after the fall of the Iron Curtain. These days Novomatic operates casinos from Berlin to Santiago de Chile (many under the Admiral brand name) while also selling slot machines, video poker games, video lottery, multiplayer games and electronic table games. Graf collects vintage cars, mostly jaguars. He also owns a house in Carinthia, one of Austria's most beautiful regions.
