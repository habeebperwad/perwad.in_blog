			Gina Rinehart is Australia's richest citizen but her wealth is built on iron ore and her fortune can either jump or plummet depending on the price of the commodity. The daughter of a high-profile iron-ore explorer, Lang Hancock, Rinehart took her late father's bankrupted estate and rebuilt it into something much larger.  The biggest piece of her fortune comes from Hope Downs, a joint-venture mine she has with Rio Tinto. The other is the massive Roy Hill project, a world-class iron ore mine in Western Australia that started shipments to Asia in December 2015. She also owns a stake in the Ten television network and is now the largest owner of prime wagyu cattle in Australia.
