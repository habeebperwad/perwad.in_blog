			Steve Wynn is the man behind some of Las Vegas' most notable landmarks. The casino magnate developed The Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas. The first three were built by his first juggernaut, Mirage Resorts, which he was forced to sell to MGM in a hostile takeover in 2000. Two years later he launched Wynn Resorts with ex-wife Elaine Wynn.  The publicly-traded company, which operates Wynn Las Vegas, opened the $4.2 billion Wynn Palace -- its second resort in the troubled Macau gambling region -- in August 2016. That same month he broke ground in Massachusetts on the $2.1 billion Wynn Boston Harbor after a long fight to win approval from local officials. He remains mired in legal battles with Elaine over the 2010 divorce agreement that restricts Elaine's right to sell shares at will, and with former partner Kazuo Okada, who Wynn accused of bribery. (Okada denies wrongdoing.) Wynn's art collection includes a mix of old masters and contemporary artists, including a Jeff Koons "Popeye" sculpture.
