			Bernard Fraisse presides over Fareva, one of the world's largest contract pharmaceutical companies. After getting his degree in mechanical engineering, he worked as a chemical salesman before starting his own business in 1990. That first year his company generated $4.5 million in revenue.  In 2016, Fareva had more than 10,000 employees and pulled in $1.4 billion in revenue. He refuses to take any private equity money and intends to keep the company in family hands. He owns 100% of it.
