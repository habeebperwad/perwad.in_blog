			After more than 50 years in San Diego, Alexander Spanos's Chargers announced in January their move to Los Angeles for the start of the 2017 NFL season. Spanos bought a controlling stake in the Chargers in 1984, and the team is now worth $1.9 billion net of debt.  His grandchildren John and A.G. run the team, while son Dean serves as chairman. The son of Greek immigrants, Spanos started a catering company in 1951 with an $800 loan. He plowed the profits into real estate, including apartment complexes. Today his A.G. Spanos Co. develops master-planned communities and multifamily housing across the country.
