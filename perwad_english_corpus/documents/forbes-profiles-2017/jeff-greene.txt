			Real estate tycoon Jeff Greene has relisted his Palazzo di Amore estate in California after a yearlong hiatus. This time Greene is asking $129 million, a haircut from the original $195 million he sought in 2014 when it was the most expensive home for sale in the country.  The Palm Beach resident, who is a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago, opened the Greene School for "high potential" children in September 2016, with about 50 students, including his three children. In December 2015 his Greene Institute hosted a conference on closing the income gap; next up is one on "Managing The Disruption." A Democrat, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2010, Greene has lived on both sides of the economic divide. His dad was a used textile machinery dealer who lost his livelihood when the industry moved south. He never recovered and died of a heart attack at age 51. His mother, formerly a homemaker, began waitressing. Greene got into Johns Hopkins and worked his way through, teaching Hebrew and working as a busboy at The Breakers resort in Palm Beach. He later traveled the country selling circus tickets to pay for Harvard Business School. He bought his first house as a grad student, renting out rooms. He had 18 properties when he graduated.  Today the bulk of his fortune is in real estate: he owns some 30 properties in Florida plus 3,500 apartments in Los Angeles and 3 buildings in downtown Manhattan.
