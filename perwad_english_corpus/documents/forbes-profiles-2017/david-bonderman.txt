The firm lost big with its 2008 deal with Apollo Global Management to buy Harrah's, later renamed Caesars Entertainment, for $28 billion.  But it appears to have patched things up with bondholders who claimed billions of dollars in damages by putting more money into bankrupt Caesars operating company. TPG closed a $10.5 billion fund in May 2016. The son of a Russian immigrant, "Bondo" attended U. of Washington, then Harvard Law. He met Coulter while working for Robert Bass. The pair left to found TPG. One of their fist big deals together came when they invested $66 million in faltering Continental Airlines and ultimately made a $640 million profit.
