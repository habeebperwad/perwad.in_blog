			Dustin Moskovitz helped launch Facebook with then-roommate Mark Zuckerberg from their Harvard dorm. He dropped out of Harvard after two years and joined Zuckerberg in Palo Alto to work on Facebook. After leaving the social network in 2008, he cofounded Asana, a workflow software company, though most of his net worth still comes from his estimated 3% stake in Facebook; he has an agreement that allows Mark Zuckerberg to vote his shares.  Moskovitz is married to former Wall Street Journal reporter Cari Tuna. Together, the couple has built philanthropic foundation Good Ventures, which has given millions of dollars to causes that range from malaria eradication to marriage equality. In September 2016, the couple also committed $20 million to Democrats for the 2016 election cycle.
