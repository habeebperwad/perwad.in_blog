			John Collison is cofounder and president of Stripe, the company that lets businesses and individuals easily accept payments over the internet. His 550-person startup processes billions of dollars in transactions per year in 25 different countries.  In November 2016 Stripe closed a $150 million funding round that valued the business at $9.2 billion. The transaction turned Collison into the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He and his brother Patrick hatched the idea for Stripe during a vacation to South Africa while John was still an undergrad studying physics at Harvard; the pair launched the company in 2010. Despite their young age, this isn't the brothers' first success. They previously founded Auctomatic, which helped manage transactions for sellers on sites like Amazon and eBay. They sold the business to Live Current Media for $5 million in 2008, becoming teenage millionaires. Collison was born and raised in the countryside near Limerick, Ireland, where his parents ran a lakeside hotel. He and Patrick took up coding as kids, competing against each other to master the craft.
