			Duty-free tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's King Power has a monopoly on retail operations at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi and Don Muang airports. It reported a 20% rise in revenues to $2.4 billion in 2016 on the continuing influx of Chinese tourists, its biggest customers.  It also runs three shopping complexes in Bangkok but faces new competition from South Korea's Lotte Group, which opened its first duty free store in Bangkok in December. Eyeing expansion beyond retail, Vichai bought a 39% stake in Thai AirAsia for $225 million last year. He recently sacked the manager of his English football club Leicester City, which had created history last year by winning the English Premier League championship, due to the team's poor performance in recent matches.
