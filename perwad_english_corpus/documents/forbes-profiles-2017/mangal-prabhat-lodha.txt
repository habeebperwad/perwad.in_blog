			Mumbai politician and property magnate Mangal Prabhat Lodha's privately held Lodha Group, run by sons Abhishek and Abhinandan, is building Mumbai's first Trump Tower. The 75-story luxury skyscraper, located in a complex called The Park, is due to be completed by 2018. Last year, Lodha completed the first 60-story tower of its landmark World Towers project in midtown Mumbai, billed as the world's tallest residence.  A native of the desert state of Rajasthan, Lodha started off building middle-class homes in Mumbai's far-flung suburbs. After his sons joined the business in 2003, the firm went on an expansion binge picking up prime land parcels.
