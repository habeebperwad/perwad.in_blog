			Dick Yuengling turned his family's struggling coal-town brewery into a powerhouse with $550 million in sales in 2015. He is the fifth generation to own D.G. Yuengling & Son, America's oldest brewery. When he bought out his father in 1985 it was producing 137,000 barrels per year; today it's one of the country's five largest beer companies, pumping out some 2.8 million barrels annually.  Yuengling drives a dirty Toyota Camry and heads to work so early every morning he has to pick up the newspaper directly from the distributor. Like the four generations before him, he refuses to sell out. Instead, after three decades lording over the business (sometimes manning forklifts and personally backing semi-trucks into his loading dock) he is preparing to hand the company to his four daughters -- if he can let go of the reins. "If I reach 100, I'll retire," he half-joked recently.
