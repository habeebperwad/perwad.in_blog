			Rita Tong Liu breaks into the billionaire ranks in 2017 thanks to a vast Hong Kong property portfolio that includes entire floors in Grand Millennium Plaza, Shun Tak Centre, Far East Financial Centre, Lippo Centre and the Admiralty Centre.  She also owns all of the China Insurance Group Building, Austin Plaza and four other buildings. Liu got into the real estate business in 1976, wading into luxury flats and houses. She later went into the business of parking spaces, earning the nickname "car-park queen." After her husband died in 2003 she transitioned into grade-A commercial offices spaces, capitalizing on the tight supply and gravity-defying prices in Hong Kong's financial district. Under the family's Gale Well Group, Liu continues to lean on her two loyal lieutenants, younger brothers, Jacinto Tong, 65, and Luis Tong, 63, and also on her only son, Jeffery, who also runs his own real estate company.
