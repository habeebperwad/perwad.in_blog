			Indian telecom tycoon Sunil Mittal's Bharti Airtel is embroiled in a bruising price war with Mukesh Ambani's low cost 4G phone service Reliance Jio, which was launched last September. To fight off the mighty rival, Mittal bought additional 4G spectrum last year and recently inked an agreement to acquire rival Telenor's Indian unit.  In January, the telecom magnate launched the Airtel Payment Bank, a niche bank, in a joint venture with Kotak Mahindra Bank controlled by fellow billionaire Uday Kotak. Mittal's wealth is up on new information about his private assets, including SoftBank-backed messaging service Hike run by son Kavin, which achieved unicorn status when its last funding round valued it at $1.4 billion. Mittal is also chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce.
