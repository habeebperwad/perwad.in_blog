			Eduardo Belmont is the owner and president of Belcorp, a door-to-door cosmetics company that operates in 16 Latin American countries and the United States. Hundreds of thousands of "beauty consultants" sell Belcorp products from their homes and in their neighborhoods.  Belcorp's revenues slipped to about $1.19 billion in 2015, a drop of some $210 million from the previous year. Eduardo and his brother Fernando used to run a jointly-owned cosmetics firm called Yanbal, but in 1988 the two parted ways and each now runs his own beauty enterprise. Fernando's company kept the Yanbal name.
