			Deniz Sahenk is the wife of Dogus Holding founder Ayhan Sahenk, who died of a heart attack in 2001. The family conglomerate operates in sectors ranging from tourism, real estate and media to financial services, construction and automotive import and distribution.  In 2012 it formed d.ream (Dogus Restaurant Entertainment and Management), which now encompasses around 170 outlets operating under restaurant brands developed internally as well as through partnerships with the likes of Azumi Group, whose brands include Coya, Roka, Zuma and Oblix. In 2014 the family sold 15% of Garanti Bank to the Spanish BBVA for more than $2 billion. In early 2017 it announced the sale of its remaining 10% for around $920 million. In a 2016 spree, betting on high-end European tourism, Dogus bought Astir Palace and the Athens Hilton in Greece, the D-Resort Sibenik in Croatia and the Capri Palace in Capri, Italy. It also added to its collection the Hotel Villamagna in Madrid and the Aldrovandi Palace, located in Rome's luxurious Paroli area and known as "heaven in the middle of Rome." Deniz Sahenk's children Ferit and Filiz Sahenk are also billionaires.
