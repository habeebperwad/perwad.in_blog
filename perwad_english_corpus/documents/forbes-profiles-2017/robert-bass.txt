They finally sold their oil interests in early 2017 to ExxonMobil for $6 billion.  Robert ventured off on his own in 1986, creating a family office that became Oak Hill Capital Partners. Private jet start-up Aerion is the most high-profile investment by low-profile Robert. Working with Airbus, Aerion seeks to build the first supersonic business jets. Pricetag: $120 million. In 2012 he acquired a place in Manhattan's 834 Fifth Avenue for a reported $42 million.

Their foundation is endowed with more than $90 million.
