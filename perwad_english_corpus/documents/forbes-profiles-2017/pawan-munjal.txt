			Pawan Munjal, son of late Brijmohan Lall Munjal, founder of Hero Group, who died in 2015 at age 92, runs motorcycle flagship Hero MotoCorp. A former partner of Japan's Honda, Hero is the world's largest producer of 2-wheelers by volume.  It has sold more than 70 million units to date, of which close to 7 million were sold in 2016. Pawan has led a global expansion after parting ways with Honda 6 years ago. Hero's first overseas factory is located in Colombia and it is building a new one in Bangladesh. The company has also invested $126 million in a new research unit in Jaipur city that employs 500 engineers. In what was seen as a family divide, younger sibling Sunil stepped down as Hero' s joint managing director last August to run his own independent businesses.
