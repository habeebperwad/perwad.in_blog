			Vivien Chen, the younger daughter of the late billionaire Chen Din Hwa, resigned as chairman of the family's privately held Nan Fung Group in March 2016 and was appointed honorary chairman without day-to-day involvement.  Vivien has called the shots at one of the largest business dynasties in Hong Kong since 2009 after three decades of being groomed for the role. In 2014 she launched a plan to spend $90 million on revitalizing the group's original textile factory as part of an initiative to support fashion startups in Hong Kong. Outside of Nan Fung, she's been buying commercial property in Hong Kong and London. She lost a lawsuit in November 2016 to her mother over  the distribution of the family's wealth.
