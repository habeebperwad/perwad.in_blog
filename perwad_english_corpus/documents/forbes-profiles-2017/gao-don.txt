					After Black & Decker decided to make the grinders itself, Gao launched his own brand, Worx. and his firm, Positec, now one of China's largest producers of power tools.


				
				
					Positec's tools are sold at retailers like Lowe's, Home Depot and Sears in the U.S.

				
				
					Gao also invests in real estate.
