			Media mogul turned digital tycoon Barry Diller chairs online travel site Expedia and owns a 7% stake in IAC/InterActiveCorp, an online conglomerate with two dozen web companies, including CollegeHumor and Dictionary. com. Founded by Diller in 1995, IAC has doubled down on online dating; it controls Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com, all publicaly traded under parent company The Match Group. Diller dropped out of UCLA and got a job in the mail room at the William Morris talent agency. He worked at ABC, Paramount and Fox, and oversaw launches of hit TV shows, including "Cheers" and "The Simpsons." Diller has since turned his attention to parks, helping develop Manhattan's High Line walkway and pledging $150 million for a new waterfront park in New York called Pier 55. He is married to designer Diane von Furstenberg and has a stake in her fashion company.
