			Eric Lefkofksy made his fortune from the daily deals site Groupon he founded in 2008 with longtime business partner Brad Keywell, but he's since moved onto his next big venture, Uptake, which he also cofounded with Keywell.  Uptake uses data science to improve other companies' operations and safety. It's raised an estimated $120 million to gain a $2 billion valuation since 2014. Together Lefkofsky and Keywell also founded Chicago venture capital firm Lightbank, which has made investments in over 100 companies including e-commerce company BeachMint and dating app Coffee Meets Bagel. Lefkofsky also cofounded and runs healthcare startup called Tempus that is focused on using data to treat cancer. Lefkofksy grew up outside of Detroit and went to the University of Michigan for his undergraduate and law degrees. After a girlfriend dumped him his freshman year, Lefkofsky started his first business, selling carpets.
