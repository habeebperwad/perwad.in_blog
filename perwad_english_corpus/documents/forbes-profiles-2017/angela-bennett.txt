			Angela Bennett is the reclusive half-owner of an iron-ore royalty paid to Wright Prospecting; the other half goes to the two daughters of her late brother, Michael Wright. Her family firm, AMB Holdings, has expanding property and oil-and-gas interests.  Bennett's father, Peter Wright, and his partner, Lang Hancock, negotiated the royalty on iron ore mined in Western Australia's Pilbara region. Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, inherited his share of the revenue stream.
