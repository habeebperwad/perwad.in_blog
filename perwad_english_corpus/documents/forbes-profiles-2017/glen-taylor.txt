			In the summer of 2015, Glen Taylor stepped down as CEO of Taylor Corp., originally a local wedding service business where he worked throughout college. Taylor bought the business for $2 million in 1975, and still serves as its chairman.  His niece Deb Taylor is now CEO of the $2.1 billion (2015 sales) printing giant, which recently acquired Staples Print Solutions, a division of Staples, Inc. A Minnesota man all his life, Taylor owns the state's NBA team, the Timberwolves, and WNBA team, the Lynx, which won its third championship in five seasons in 2015. He sold about 15% of his stake in both basketball teams in 2016 to Lizhang Jiang, a Shanghai investor and the NBA's first Chinese owner, and Meyer Orbach, a real-estate investor. Taylor also owns the Minneapolis Star Tribune, bought in 2014 for nearly $100 million.
