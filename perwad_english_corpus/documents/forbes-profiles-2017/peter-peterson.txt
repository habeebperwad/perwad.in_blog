			Peter Peterson has one of the most distinguished résumés in America. He served as secretary of commerce under President Nixon, was chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers in the '70s and early '80s, cofounded Blackstone Group in 1985 with fellow billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, and then served as the chair of New York's Federal Reserve Bank from 2000 to 2004. He made most of his fortune at Blackstone and sold a chunk of his stake for $1.85 billion (pretax) in 2007 when the company went public.  He retired from the private equity firm a year later. The son of poor Greek immigrants, Peterson held his first job during the Great Depression at age 8, working the cash register at his frugal father's 24-hour restaurant. Peterson is married to Sesame Street co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney.
