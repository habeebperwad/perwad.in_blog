			From his perch atop the world's largest private charitable foundation, Bill Gates keeps pushing to save lives in the developing world through efforts to eliminate polio, attack malaria and expand childhood vaccinations.  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is also working to improve K-12 education in the U.S., an area in which it's had fewer tangible results.The richest person in the world for 18 out of the past 23 years, Gates stepped down as Microsoft chairman in 2014 but remains a technology advisor and board member of the company he cofounded in 1975. Gates sells his Microsoft shares on a regular basis and now owns 2.3% of the company, which in turn accounts for 13% of his fortune. He also has investments in Canadian National Railway, tractor maker Deere & Co. and car dealer AutoNation. In December 2016, Gates announced the creation of a $1 billion Breakthrough Energy investment fund with about 20 other people - including Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos and Alibaba founder Jack Ma - to invest in new forms of clean energy.
