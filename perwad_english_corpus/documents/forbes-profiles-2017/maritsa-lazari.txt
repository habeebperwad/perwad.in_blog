			Maritsa Lazari is the widow of late billionaire Christos Lazari, who died in 2015, a few months shy of their 50th wedding anniversary. The pair both emigrated from the same Cyprus village; she came with her family while he arrived at age 16 to strike out on his own, initially doing odd jobs like washing dishes.  The couple, who met in London, married in 1965. Christos studied fashion design and eventually created a successful fashion line.  The couple used the profits from that business to buy up property. Today Lazari Investments owns 2.65 million square feet across London, mostly office space that it rents out. That market was hit the most by investors' Brexit fears, but the portfolio is still up due to high rents in the West End. Maritsa has been a director since the beginning, and her three children are involved in the business as well.
