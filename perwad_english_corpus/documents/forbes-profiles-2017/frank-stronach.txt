			Frank Stronach amassed his fortune in auto parts manufacturing, founding Canadian giant Magna International in 1957. Raised in Austria during Nazi-rule, he apprenticed at a tool-and-die maker before emigrating to Canada and founding the precursor to Magna.  Today the company is among the largest automotive part suppliers in the world, with more than $30 billion in sales. Stronach divested himself of all equity in the company in 2012 and 2013 and, in recent years, has been buying up Florida land for a big push into grass-fed beef. His Adena Ranch owns more than 95,000 acres across the Sunshine State, where he raises and slaughters his own beef and then sells it in retail outlets and restaurants that he owns. Stronach is also a big name in horse racing: He owns several racetracks, including Santa Anita near Los Angeles and Gulfstream Park in Florida, and is a successful breeder. In January 2017 he held the inaugural Pegasus Cup, billed as "the world's richest Thoroughbred race" thanks to its $12 million purse, at Gulfstream Park.
