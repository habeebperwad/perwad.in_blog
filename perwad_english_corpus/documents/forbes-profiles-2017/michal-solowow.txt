			Investor Michal Solowow has slowly been withdrawing his companies from the Warsaw Stock Exchange stating that the public markets do not adequately value his investments. His sole remaining listed investment in synthetic rubber producer Synthos which has been performing well over the past year.  Currently embroiled in investigation by the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation over controversial reprivatizations of properties in Warsaw; Solowow denies allegations of wrong-doing. Solowow started out in the late 1980s with construction company Mitex, which he sold in 2002 to French investor Eiffage and plowed proceeds in the nascent Polish stock market. The once avid race car driver has since given up racing after a scrap in 2014 when his car overturned at a European rally; he came out unscathed.
