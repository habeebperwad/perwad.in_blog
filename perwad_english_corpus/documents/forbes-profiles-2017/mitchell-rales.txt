			In a rare public moment, Danaher Corp, the industrial conglomerate controlled by Mitchell and his equally private brother, Steven, split in July 2016, spinning off some of its assets into Fortive Corp. The Rales brothers started building what would become Danaher in the 1980s, buying up companies quickly.  Taking what they learned at their dad's real estate company, they jumped into the takeover game by focusing on tax avoidance and cash flow. They acquired their first company in 1981, a vinyl-siding manufacturer called Master Shield. It threw off enough cash to finance further acquisitions. One, in 1983, was a crippled REIT they renamed Danaher after a Montana stream where they once fished for trout. The brothers merged their profitable acquisitions into the loss-making REIT, using it as a shield against taxes. They survived the financial crises in the 80s and 90s and prospered, always searching for their next bounty. All told, they acquired more than three dozen companies, allowing Danaher to become a massive, if unstylish, firm with $17 billion in revenues in 2016. Their success allowed Mitchell to pursue his interest in art; he built the Glenstone Museum outside Washington, D.C., which exhibits artists like Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock.
