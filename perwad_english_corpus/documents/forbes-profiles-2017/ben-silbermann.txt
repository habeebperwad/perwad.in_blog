			Growing up in Iowa, Ben Silbermann collected dried insects and pinned them to cardboard. Now, he is at the helm of the virtual version of that childhood pastime, Pinterest. The photo bookmarking site, most recently valued at $11 billion, lets users save and share image collections of anything from recipes and hairstyles to crafts and home decor through their mobile phones or computers.  With cofounders Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra, Silbermann launched the first desktop version of Pinterest in March 2010.
