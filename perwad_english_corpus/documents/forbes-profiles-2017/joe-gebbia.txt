			Joe Gebbia cofounded peer-to-peer home and apartment rental company Airbnb in 2008. As chief product officer, Gebbia helped Airbnb make a push into business travel in 2015, while expanding in new markets such as Africa and Cuba.  In September 2016, the company raised $555 million at a $30 billion valuation as part of a funding round that will reportedly total $850 million. Investors previously valued the company at $25 billion in June 2015. Gebbia came up with the idea for the company with classmate Brian Chesky, now the CEO, after they graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design. More than 60 million people have used Airbnb, which lists more than 2 million homes and apartments in more than 190 countries.
