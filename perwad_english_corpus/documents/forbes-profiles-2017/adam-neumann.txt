			Raised on a kibbutz in Israel, Adam Neumann has turned communal work space memberships that go for as low as $45 a month into a business worth nearly $17 billion. He is CEO of WeWork, which rents out co-working space, often with perks like arcade rooms and on-site beer kegs, in over 30 cities in 12 countries around the world.  Up next is India, slated for 2017. He cofounded the company with Miguel McKelvey in 2010. It has raised $1.7 billion to date, including another $260 million as part of its series F funding round in October 2016. Neumann moved to New York City in 2001 following his sister, a Miss Teen Israel, as she pursued a modeling career. Before WeWork he ran a business that made baby overalls with built-in knee pads.
