			Nancy Walton Laurie inherited a stake in Wal-Mart from her father, Bud Walton, who cofounded the retailer in 1962 with his older brother, Sam. When Bud died in 1995 Nancy and her sister, Ann Walton Kroenke, received enough Wal-Mart stock to make them both billionaires.  Nancy and her husband, Bill Laurie, also own Missouri's Providence Bank, several homes and a yacht. In 1998 she founded Columbia Performing Arts Centre, a performing arts school for children through high schoolers in Columbia, Missouri. She remains actively involved, overseeing curriculum and regularly attending performances. Nancy and Bill purchased the NHL's St. Louis Blues in 1999. They sold the team six years later.
