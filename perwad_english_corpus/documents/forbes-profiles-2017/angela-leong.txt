			Angela Leong, the fourth wife of Macau legend Stanley Ho, is the largest individual shareholder and the managing director of casino company SJM Holdings. The company is controlled by Sociedade deTurismo e Divers√µes de Macau, or STDM, and was started by Ho.  An elected Macau legislator for the past 11 years, Leong hopes to revive SJM's fortunes with its first Cotai resort, the $3.9-billion Lisboa Palace, which is expected to open in 2018. Meanwhile, she owes the vast majority of her wealth to her impressive portfolio of Hong Kong properties.
