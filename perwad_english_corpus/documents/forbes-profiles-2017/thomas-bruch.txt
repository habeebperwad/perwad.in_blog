			Thomas Bruch is the fifth generation of his family to preside over retailer Globus SB-Warenhaus Holding GmbH & Co. KG. His great-great-grandfather Franz Bruch opened the first store in St. Wedel in 1828. In Germany, the company owns 47 hypermarkets, 90 hardware stores (11 of which are former Max-Bahr und Praktiker markets), seven electrical appliance stores, two pick-up supermarkets and a restaurant.  Globus also owns two hardware stores in Luxembourg as well as 25 hypermarkets in Russia and the Czech Republic. Thomas took over from his father in 1979. One of his three sons also works in the business, which generates annual revenue of around $7.4 billion. Globus offers its 43,200 employees the chance to invest in and profit from the performance of the company though silent partnerships. Currently, about 80 million euros are deposited in total. Thomas and his family own 80% of the company, including a 25% stake held by two family foundations, while a charitable foundation established by Bruch holds the remaining 20%. With an annual budget of slightly over $1 million, it supports a range of social projects including training for youth with learning disabilities, a multicultural youth integration center, helping Ebola patients on Sierra Leone and schools in Ruanda, Nigeria and Uganda. Administrative expenses are paid for privately by Thomas.
