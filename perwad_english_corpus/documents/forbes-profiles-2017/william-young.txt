			William Young and his father founded Plastipak, a plastic containers maker, shortly after Bill graduated from the University of Detroit with an engineering degree in 1967. After six years of running the business, they sold the majority to Beatrice Foods for an undisclosed amount.  The family kept a stake in Plastipak while Bill continued to run it as a division of Beatrice. In 1982, the family bought back Plastipak. Three decades later, a division of Goldman Sachs picked up a minority stake. Today Young is still president and CEO of the firm, which manufactures plastic packaging for companies such as Procter & Gamble, Pepsi and Kraft Foods. It also holds over 600 U.S. patents for package design and manufacturing processes. Young's father died of a heart attack in 2005 at age 90.
