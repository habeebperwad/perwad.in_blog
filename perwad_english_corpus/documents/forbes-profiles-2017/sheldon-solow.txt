			The son of a bricklayer who immigrated from Russia and a homemaker from Brooklyn, Solow risked everything in 1972 to build 9 West 57 Street. Home to KKR, Apollo Global Management, Tiger Global Management and Chanel, the tower is known for unobstructed views of Central Park.  He paid $128 million for 16 West 57th Street, a 5-story building, in May 2016. He's building a 42-story residential building overlooking the East River; after years of gridlock he finally broke ground in March 2016.
