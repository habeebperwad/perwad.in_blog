			Kim Taek-Jin made a fortune creating online video games. While still a student at Seoul National University's College of Engineering, he developed software that helped users practice typing in Korean.  After he received his master's degree in 1991, he worked for Hyundai Electronics' R&D Center in Boston and later became head of development for AmiNet, the division of Hyundai Electronics that launched Korea's first Internet access service.  He founded NCSoft in 1997 and turned it into the world's top online game company after developing the hit "Lineage," a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). He took the company public in 2003, and still serves as CEO. NCSoft now provides online game services to over 60 countries. An avid sports fan, Kim founded the Korean professional baseball team NC Dinos in 2011. He sold most of his NCSoft shares in 2012 and now has just under a 12% stake.
