			High school friends turned business partners Paul Allen and Bill Gates cofounded software giant Microsoft in 1975. Eight years later, Allen left Microsoft after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He beat the disease.  He plays guitar in a rock band called the Underthinkers. His aircraft company Vulcan Aerospace previewed its project to build the world's largest aircraft to air launch satellites into space in June 2016. He also has three professional sports franchises. He bought the first one, the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team, for $70 million in 1988. Local politicians talked him into buying the Seattle Seahawks football team for $288 million in 1997. They were just trying to keep the team from moving, but it turned out to be a great investment. The Seahawks are now worth $2.2 billion, according to FORBES. Plus he has an interest in the Seattle Sounders, the most valuable Major League Soccer team in America; the team is worth $285 million. A two-time cancer survivor, he has given away more than $2 billion, including $500 million to his Allen Institute for Brain Science, which studies the brain's connections with health and disease. Additionally, Allen is focused on wildlife conservation; he funded the Great Elephant Census, which showed that Africa's elephant population had decreased 30% between 2007 and 2014.
