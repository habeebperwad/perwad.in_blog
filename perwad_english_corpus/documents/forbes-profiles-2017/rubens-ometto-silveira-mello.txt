			Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello is the world's first ethanol billionaire. His sugar giant, Cosan, started out in the hum-drum world of sugar production. Over the years the company has become one of Brazil's only privately controlled energy companies and is now also in the process of expanding into railroad company America Latina Logistics.  The company's origins date from 1936, when Ometto's grandparents established a sugarcane mill in Piracicaba, northwest of Sao Paulo. Ometto bought out the 23 family shareholders in 1990, and turned Cosan into Brazil's first New York Stock Exchange listed sugarcane company.
