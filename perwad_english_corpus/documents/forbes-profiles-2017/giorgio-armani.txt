			A living legend in the fashion world, Giorgio Armani was born into a working-class family in Piacenza, Italy. After a stint at medical school, Armani fulfilled his military service and then got a job as a buyer and window dresser for La Rinascente, a department store in Milan.  Armani left to design clothes for Nino Cerruti and eventually launched his own line in the mid-1970s with the help of his partner Sergio Galeotti. Known for his fitted, minimalist style, Armani's business surged after he was asked to design the wardrobe for the 1980 Hollywood blockbuster film American Gigolo, starring Richard Gere. Since then, the brand has expanded into every corner of fashion including accessories, perfumes, makeup, jeans, sportswear, and haute couture-as well as interior design, real estate, restaurants, and hotels. Giorgio is the sole owner of the Armani empire.
