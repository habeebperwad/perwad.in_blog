			The great-grandson of Adam Opel, the pioneering namesake of the German car company, Georg von Opel graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a degree in business administration. Inheriting $150 million in 1989 after his father's death, he entered the investment business through Hansa AG.  He has invested in various private equity deals and listed companies, building up an impressive track record as a contrarian value investor. Von Opel owns 100% of Hansa, with an estimated value of $2 billion. Included under Hansa's umbrella is Athris Holding, which owns stakes in a Swiss hotel chain, a restaurant chain, a sports retailer and shopping centers in Russia and Algeria. Exemplifying Von Opel's interest in socially responsible and sustainable building development, is St. Martin Tower in Frankfurt, a high-rise commercial building, opened in 2015, offering tenants concierge, day care and other services. It was built by Hansa subsidiary Immo Hansa Beteiligung. Meanwhile, von Opel has shifted into investing in renewable energy assets including a wind farm with 43 wind turbines, two bio natural gas power plants and 29 biomass power plants. The Georg and Emily von Opel Foundation funds care and education of underprivileged children and teens in developing countries. After four girls, Georg became the father of a son, Louis, in 2013.
