			When Al Lerner died in 2002, his daughter Nancy inherited a piece of his banking fortune. The son of Russian immigrants, Al started his career as a furniture salesman, invested his earnings in Cleveland-area real estate, then got into finance.  He bought control of Equitable Bancorp in 1981, combined it with Maryland National in 1989 and spun off credit card giant MBNA two years later. The family eventually merged MBNA with Bank of America in 2005 to create a $35 billion banking and credit card behemoth. The Lerners are revered in Cleveland, having brought pro football back to the city in 1999 with the reintroduction of the Cleveland Browns. The family sold the team to billionaire Jimmy Haslam for roughly $1 billion in 2012. The family also previously owned the English football club Aston Villa for a short time.
