			Stephen Mandel founded Lone Pine Capital in 1997 after stints at Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson's legendary hedge fund Tiger Management. Through Lone Pine, Mandel, who is known as Steve, has built a reputation as a master of fundamental analysis and bottom-up stock picking, amassing assets of nearly $30 billion.  He named the company for a pine tree that, legend has it, survived a lighting strike on the campus of Dartmouth College, his alma mater, in 1887. Mandel, who has an MBA from Harvard and resides in Greenwich, Connecticut, serves on Dartmouth's Board of Trustees, which he chaired from 2010 to 2014.
