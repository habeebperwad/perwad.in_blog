			Commodities king Kumar Birla, who chairs the $41 billion (revenue) Aditya Birla Group, has lately been busy restructuring his empire. Last year he initiated a merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo with cash-rich Grasim Industries, followed by the demerger of the financial-services business into a separate company.  In another big move, he orchestrated a merger between his telecom unit Idea Cellular and Vodafone's Indian arm to create India's biggest telecom company to take on Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio. Birla is also reportedly mulling the sale of his fertilizer business to Indian-born Indonesian billionaire Sri Prakash Lohia.
