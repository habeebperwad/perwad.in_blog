			Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed public disinterest in 2016 at the idea of serving as President-elect Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary. But even without a slot in the administration, Trump's election has been favorable to Dimon.  JP Morgan's stock rose by more than 20% in the month after Election Day, soaring to an all-time high and adding more than $50 billion to the company's market cap. Dimon, a graduate of Tufts University and Harvard Business School, has run the firm since 2005, and has led the mega-bank through the financial crisis and on to annual revenues of nearly $90 billion. He took time off of work in 2015 after receiving treatment for throat cancer, but has since returned full-time and has a positive long-term prognosis.
