			In his 70s, Clayton Mathile is one of the oldest entrepreneurs with his own a tech unicorn. His video-service company, ooVoo, which has more than 150 million users, competes with Skype and Google Hangouts.  Unlike many tech entrepreneurs, Mathile already had plenty of money when he started the business. He sold his first commercial success, pet food company Iams, to Procter & Gamble for $2.3 billion in 1999. Born on a farm in Ohio, Mathile starred on his high school basketball team, married a cheerleader from the rival school, and got a job working at General Motors, then Campbell Soup Company, after college. In 1970, he left Campbell's for Iams, which at the time was just a small company with five employees. After selling the business nearly three decades later, Mathile gave his employees $100 million and used another $130 million to create a center for entrepreneurship called Aileron, which helps entrepreneurs with small and medium-sized businesses think about how to grow their companies.
