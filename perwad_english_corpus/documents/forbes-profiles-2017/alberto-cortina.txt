			Alberto Cortina and his cousin Alberto Alcocer used to be married to sister heiresses Alicia and Esther Koplowitz. Los Albertos, as they are known in Spain, ran their wives' construction company Construcciones y Contratas from the early 1970s until 1989, when both marriages ended.  The sisters took over the construction company, and Los Albertos moved onto banking, running Banco Zaragozano. They sold their combined 40% stake to Barclays in 2004 and now hold stakes in construction firm Actividades de Construccion y Servicios and eucalyptus pulp producer Grupo Empresarial ENCE. The cousins are also kings of the Spanish countryside, with more than a dozen sprawling ranches spread throughout Spain. Cortina, who also owns a vast art collection, reportedly enjoys boating and hunting.
