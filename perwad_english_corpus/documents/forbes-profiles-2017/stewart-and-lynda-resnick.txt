			Nearly half of all Americans purchase one of Stewart and Lynda Resnick's products each year, whether Halos mandarin oranges, POM Wonderful, Fiji Water, or others sold by their Wonderful Company. The biggest chunk of their fortune comes from growing pistachios and almonds on 64,000 acres in California.  Amid the state's ongoing drought, the company has invested $120 million in sustainable technologies. Part of that has gone toward developing drought resistant pistachio "super-tree" roots, which use less water. Their company also uprooted 10,000 almond acres in March 2016 due to the drought. The couple built a charter school in the poor Central Valley farming community where Wonderful has lots of acreage; it opened to its first students in August 2016. The couple met in 1970 when Stewart came to Lynda's marketing agency looking for help. Instead of securing the account, they got married. Stewart's eye for business led them to purchase large swaths of California Central Valley farmland in 1978.
