			Jean-Michel Besnier, along with siblings Marie and Emmanuel, inherited French dairy giant Lactalis, based in his ancestral hometown of Laval in western France. His father founded the company, which sells over $18 billion of products including President brie, Milkmaid yogurts and Valbreso Feta.  Brother Emmanuel runs the company. The biggest dairy producer in Europe, Lactalis continues to expand internationally in places like China and Southeast Asia.  The family's holding companies also own stakes in Italy's publicly traded Parmalat and Frommageries Bel, the French maker of Baby Bel, La Vache Qui Rit and Boursin.
