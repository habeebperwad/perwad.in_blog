					Apparel maker Hongdou has come a long way since it was founded back in 1957 by Zhou Yaoting's father as a cotton processing operation with three employees in a rented space near Wuxi.  
				
				
					Months after, local officials forced him to merge with two other businesses into what was in effect a government-controlled collective. 
				
				
					The family over time bought back government shares, paving the way for new growth that has made the business one China's largest apparel makers.
