			John Edson worked a paper route and earned enough to build his first boat at age 13. An entrepreneur who loves the water, in 1955 he purchased the brand name "Bayliner" for $100 and started a company to build affordable plywood motorboats.  He sold Bayliner to The Brunswick Corporation in 1986 for $425 million and spent some years cruising the world on his 161-foot boat Evviva (Italian for "long live"). In 1994 boat building lured him back and he bought Westport Yards, which he sold in 2014. He has endowed the University of Arizona with $5.4 million for the Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative. Through the J Orin Edson Foundation he makes donations to medical establishments that fight diseases, primarily cancer.
