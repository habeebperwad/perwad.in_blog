			Alexandra Daitch owns an estimated 3% of Cargill, the largest private company in America. She and her three billionaire sisters -- Lucy Stitzer, Katherine Tanner and Sarah MacMillan -- inherited stakes in the company from their father W.  Duncan MacMillan, who died in 2006. They are four of 14 billionaire descendants of W.W. Cargill, who started the company in a single warehouse in 1865. Daitch is just as private as the rest of her relatives. "They want to draw the curtain down," says Cargill CEO David MacLennan. "A lot of rich people want to be on TV, want you to know who they are and that they own this and that. Not these people."
