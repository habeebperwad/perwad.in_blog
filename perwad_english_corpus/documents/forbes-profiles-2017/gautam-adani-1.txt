			Indian ports tycoon Gautam Adani's long-delayed plan to build one of the world's largest coal mines in Queensland, Australia is finally seeing the light of days after securing court and government approvals.  The $16 billion project involves building a railway line and port, for which Adani has sought a $1 billion loan from an Australian government fund. At home, Adani has expanded into solar power with projects in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan, and is looking to get into the defence sector. It has a joint venture with Israel's Elbit Sytems to make drones and is reportedly in talks with Sweden's Saab to make fighter jets. Adani is setting up a fund to invest in infrastructure projects.
