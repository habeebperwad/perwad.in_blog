			Hong Kong's richest person, Li Ka-shing is one of the most influential tycoons in Asia, with interests in everything from ports, utilities and telecom to real estate and retail. His companies employ over 310,000 people in more than 50 nations.  He's been shifting much of his focus to Europe, where he invested more than $28 billion over five years. More recently he invested in Postal Savings Bank of China and also announced a more than $5 billion deal to acquire Australian electricity and pipeline company Duet. His rags-to-riches story is legendary: Li and his family fled China for Hong Kong during the Sino-Japanese war. Not long after their arrival Li's father, who had been a primary school principal in China, died from tuberculosis. At age 12 Li quit school and started as an apprentice in a watch-strap factory. By 14 he was working full-time in a plastics trading company. He eventually quit to start his own business making plastic toys and everyday items, and later plastic flowers.
