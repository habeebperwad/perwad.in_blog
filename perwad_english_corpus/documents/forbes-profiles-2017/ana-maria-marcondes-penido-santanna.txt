			Ana Maria Marcondes Penido Sant'Anna is vice president of the board of the CCR Group, a Brazilian toll road builder and operator. CCR was founded by Ana Maria's father, Pelerson Soares Penido, who died in 2012 at the age of 93 and left the bulk of his fortune to her and her sister Rosa Evangelina Penido.  Rosa Evangelina, who owns fewer shares in CCR, has a separate multi-million dollar fortune. CCR has been growing its partnerships with local and federal governments in recent years as more highways are being privatized. The company also owns 34% of STP, an electronic payment system for toll operators similar to E-Z Pass, used by more than 4.1 million vehicles. Ana Maria has a degree in business administration from Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo.
