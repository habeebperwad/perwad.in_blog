			Michel Leclercq set up a small sporting goods store called Decathlon in 1976. It has since grown into one of the world's largest athletic retailers, with more than $8 billion in sales from nearly 900 stores, employing 60,000 people in 27 countries.  Leclercq is cousin of Gerard Mulliez, the patriarch of the famed French retail dynasty. Leclerq and his immediate family own 40% of the company while the extended Mulliez family have another 40%.
