			Jerry Yang dropped out of a Stanford Ph.D. program to found Yahoo with David Filo in 1995. He briefly served as Yahoo's CEO but stepped down in January 2009 after turning down an acquisition offer from Microsoft.  He left Yahoo's board in 2012. Yang made a smart bet in championing Yahoo's $1 billion investment in Alibaba, China's e-commerce giant, in 2005. He now sits on Alibaba's board and owns a small stake in the company. Since 2012, he has also made bets on more than 50 data-related startups through his venture investing firm, AME Cloud Ventures. Investments include AtScale, an analytics firm; Zipline, which plans to use drones to deliver vaccines and blood; and FiscalNote, which analyzes government data. Yang is also on the board of enterprise software firm Workday. He immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan at age 10 with his mother (his father died when he was 2). He earned a B.S. and M.S. in electrical engineering from Stanford. A former Chinese calligraphy student, he has a collection of about 250 works of ancient Chinese calligraphy from the Ming and Qing eras.
