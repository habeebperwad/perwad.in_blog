			Estee Lauder chairman William Lauder is the fifth Lauder family heir to be named an individual billionaire from the cosmetics giant founded by his grandmother in 1946. As the eldest son of former CEO and executive chairman Leonard Lauder, William started being groomed to lead the company early.  He joined in 1986 as a regional marketing director of Clinique and worked his way up to the chief executive officer post in 2004. In 2009, he moved from that role to chairman of the board, replacing his father. Since then, the stock has increased three-fold. William lives in a Park Avenue coop, and he also has homes in Westchester and Aspen. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and now sits on the board. He started lecturing Penn MBA students in "Decision Making in the Leadership Chair" in 2012.
