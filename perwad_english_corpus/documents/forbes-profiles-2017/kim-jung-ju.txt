			Kim Jung-Ju is the founder of online-gaming company Nexon and one of the new breed of self-made billionaires in a country that is dominated by chaebol wealth (South Korea's family-run conglomerates). In December 2016 Kim was found not guilty of bribery charges after being indicted in July 2016 for giving money to a senior prosecutor named Jin Kyung Joon, a good friend of his at the prestigious Seoul National University.  Jin was also found not guilty. Prosecutors are planning to file an appeal. Kim issued a written apology following the indictment; he resigned as a director of Nexon, which is traded in Tokyo, in July 2016 but remains chairman of its holding company, NXC. Founded in 1994, Nexon is now South Korea's largest gaming company, with at least 350 million users in more than 72 countries. It launched the world's first online game, "Baram e Nara" (The Kingdom of the Wind), back in 1994, and went on to produce such hits as "Maple Story," "Mabinogi," and "Cart Rider."
