			Jeff Skoll, a former eBay executive, has spent the past decade as a philanthropist and film producer. His Skoll Foundation has invested approximately $400 million worldwide, supporting 96 organizations working to reduce poverty, create jobs, improve healthcare and more.  In March 2016 his Participant Media won its first best picture Academy Award for the film "Spotlight." It has received 13 Academy Awards and 50 nominations since Skoll founded it in 2004. Participant has co-produced more than 60 films aimed at inspiring social change, including "An Inconvenient Truth" and the documentary Citizenfour, about Edward Snowden. Skoll's attempt to build a millenial-focused cable TV channel sputtered; some three years after launching Pivot TV, his Participant Media said in August 2016 that it will shut down the channel. He joined eBay as its first employee in 1995 and became the company's first president; he became a billionaire as a result of his eBay stock. He left eBay in 2001. Skoll was born in Montreal, later moved to Toronto and pumped gas to pay his way through the University of Toronto. He obtained U.S. citizenship in 2007.
