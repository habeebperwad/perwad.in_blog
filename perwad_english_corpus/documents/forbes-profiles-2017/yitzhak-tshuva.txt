			Yitzhak "Isaac" Tshuva built a fortune in energy and real estate. The oil and gas reserves off the Israeli coast he developed around the year 2000 are the backbone of Delek Group, his publicly-traded conglomerate, which also has automotive and financial holdings.  His private El Ad Group, a global real estate firm, has developments in Manhattan, Florida, Montreal and Israel. El Ad Group sold Buckingham Gate, a development near Buckingham Palace in London, for $280 million in 2013. Tshuva's family immigrated from Libya to Israel when he was six months old. After his service in the Israeli army, he worked as a contractor for the Israeli Defense Ministry. He got his start in real estate in the 1970s, developing low-income housing in Israel. Tshuva has committed to selling off Delek's 31% stake in the Tamar gas field by the year 2022.
