			Lu Di put some of the earliest money into drone maker SZ Dajiang Innovation Technology (commonly known as DJI), investing about $90,000 into the company in 2006. Family friends with founder and CEO Frank Wang (also a billionaire), he was endearingly called a "penny pincher" by DJI's leader and ran the company's finances in its early years.  FORBES estimates that he owns about 16% of  DJI. Some analysts estimate that DJI has 70% of the consumer unmanned aerial vehicle market through sales of its trademark Phantom drones, which retail for around $1,000. In May 2015 the company raised $75 million from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Accel Partners, valuing the company at $8 billion.
