			Daniel Roullier began building agribusiness giant Groupe Roullier in 1959 when he acquired a maerl (an unusual seaweed) deposit along the coast of Saint-Malo, Brittany. His first company, Timac, turned this marine limestone into soil conditioner, and the group has been expanding aggressively ever since.  Today the family-owned business operates in 116 countries with 7,900 employees and pulls in revenues of $3.3 billion. Roullier remains active in the company and serves as the president of the supervisory board. In January 2015, he appointed Jorge Boucas as Roullier Group's executive board president.
