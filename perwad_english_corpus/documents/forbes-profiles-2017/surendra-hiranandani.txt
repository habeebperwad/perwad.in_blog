			Surendra Hiranandani, the younger brother of billionaire Mumbai developer Niranjan Hiranandani, runs his independent outfit, the House of Hiranandani, which specializes in luxury residences. Daughter Neha, a University of Virginia grad, helps him run the company from London.  He still owns 50% in older projects that he built along with brother Niranjan. In what was one of the country's biggest deals in commercial real estate, the brothers sold their office and retail assets in Powai to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management for $1 billion.
