			In a rare revelation about where Mike Milken is investing his money, news broke in June 2016 that executives who managed his family office investments left to form a hedge fund, Silver Rock Financial. Milken is investing several hundred million dollars but has no management ties to the fund.  In 2014 he pledged $50 million to George Washington University to fund public health programs; the university later announced the newly named Milken Institute School of Public Health. Milken, who helped finance thousands of companies over the years, chairs the Milken Institute think tank, which produces the well attended annual Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles, the Davos of the West Coast. A Los Angeles native, Milken switched majors at U.C. Berkeley to finance after the Watts riots, determined to democratize capital access. After getting his MBA at Wharton, the finance whiz joined what became investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969. He expanded the market for high-yield junk bonds and made a fortune. Milken was banned from the securities industry for life after pleading guilty to a securities fraud charge in 1990.
