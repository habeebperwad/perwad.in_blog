			William MacMillan is one of 14 billionaire relatives who control Cargill Inc., the largest private company in America. A global food conglomerate, Cargill sells food, processes crops, trades commodities, sources ingredients and offers financial risk management.  W.W. Cargill founded the company in 1865, and his descendants still own nearly all of the business today. William served on Cargill's board of directors and was a staunch advocate of keeping the company private in the 1990s, according to a book on the company's history published in 2008. His father, Cargill MacMillan Jr., who died in 2011, was a senior vice president at the company; his uncle, Whitney MacMillan, was the last family member to serve as CEO, retiring in 1995.
