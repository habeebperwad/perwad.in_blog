			Son of a schoolteacher from a small city in north India, founded fast-rising, Alibaba-backed mobile wallet Paytm, an acronym for "Pay Through Mobile", in 2011. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the government's decision to demonetize 86% of India's rupees and move to a cashless economy, Paytm has notched up 200 million registered users and 5 million transactions daily.  A recent sale of Paytm's shares values the company, in which Sharma owns close to 20%, at more than $6 billion. Sharma has spun off Paytm's e-commerce business business into a separate unit and will be starting a niche bank. Fan of Bono, Chris Martin, he dreams of starting a Sanskrit band, a language he studied in school.
