			Sebastian Piñera left the Chilean presidency in March 2014 after a four-year term. The businessman-turned-politician has a PhD in economics from Harvard and founded credit card company Bancard in 1976. After he was elected president in January 2010, he kept his campaign promise to sell his holdings.  He unloaded his 26% stake in Chilean airline LAN for $1.5 billion, sold the TV channel Chilevision to Time Warner for a reported $150 million, and sold his share of popular soccer team Blanco & Negro. Since he left office, he has been working with the charities he founded, including Fundación Futuro, which supports educational, cultural and conservation projects in Chile. He has also been a vocal critic of his successor, Michele Bachelet, and has vowed to lead Chile's conservative wing back to power in 2017, though he has not formally declared his own candidacy.
