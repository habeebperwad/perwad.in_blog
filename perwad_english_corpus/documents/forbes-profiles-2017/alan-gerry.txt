			Alan Gerry started building an upstate New York cable TV network in 1956 as a way to increase demand for TV sets--he owned a television repair shop. Four decades later, Cablevision Industries had 64 cable systems in 18 states.  He sold the firm to Time Warner in 1996 for a reported $2.7 billion, pocketing $900 million. He has used that money to start his venture capital firm, Granite Associates, which invests in emerging technologies. In 1996 he bought the site of the 1969 Woodstock festival, and built Bethel Woods Center for the Arts a decade later. He returned to the cable industry in 2013 after a 17-year absence, joining BCI Broadband's advisory board.
