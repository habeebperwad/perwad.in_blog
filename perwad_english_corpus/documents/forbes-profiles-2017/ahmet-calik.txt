With an expanding geographic footprint that stretches from Turkey and the Middle East to Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Calik Holding is active in energy, construction, banking, telecom and mining.  It has a partnership with Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. dating back to 1990s, when the companies began collaborating on plant construction projects in Central Asia. In 2015, Mitsubishi acquired a 4.5% stake in Calik Energy, which serves five cities in Turkey and has projects in Turkmenistan, Libya, Georgia, Yemen and Uzbekistan.
