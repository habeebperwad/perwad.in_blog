			Born to a mother who emigrated from Poland at age 3 and a father who came from Romania at age 14, Ira Rennert made his first fortune in junk bonds in the 1980s and then built an industrial empire that claims to haul in more than $5 billion in revenue a year.  It hasn't always been easy. The Peruvian government leveled a $163 million claim against his mining outfit Doe Run Peru after it went bankrupt. Rennert's Renco sued Peru for some $800 million after the government forced it into a costly environmental cleanup. An international tribunal of arbiters dismissed Renco's claims in July 2016. Renco has said it will continue to fight the ruling, which it claims was based on a legal technicality.
