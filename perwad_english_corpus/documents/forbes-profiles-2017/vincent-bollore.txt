			One of the titans of the French business world, Vincent Bollore runs the diversified holding company Bollore Group, which has been in the Bollore family since 1822. When Vincent assumed control in early 1981 -- not long after starting his career at Edmond de Rothschild bank -- the family business, which made paper for cigarettes and bibles, was struggling.  He overhauled it and turned it into one of the 500 largest companies in the world, with holdings in media, advertising, shipping, construction, logistics and more. The renowned buyout artist holds sizable stakes in telecom conglomerate Vivendi and advertising giant Havas. As chairman of Vivendi, Bollore has drastically increased the company's stake in Mediaset SpA, a TV company founded by Silvio Berlusconi, threatening to set off a battle for control with the former Italian prime minister. He's also been busy expanding Blue Solutions, the manufacturer of electric car batteries that he took public in 2013. Bollore is reportedly close friends with former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whom he's hosted on his yacht. He is said have collections of sparkling mineral water bottle labels and comic books.
