			Former rice trader Vanich Chaiyawan's biggest asset is Thai Life, the nation's second-biggest life insurer in which Japan's Meiji Yasuda has a 15% stake. The privately-held company, run by his son Chai, is known for its emotional TV commercials.  Eyeing regional expansion with the aim of making it an Asean-wide insurance brand, it opened an office in Myanmar. Chaiyawan also owns a 1% stake in Thai Beverage, the Singapore-listed brewer and distiller founded by fellow billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi.
