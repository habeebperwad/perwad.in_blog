			MIT engineer Baba Kalyani's flagship Bharat Forge, which he runs along with son Amit, was founded by his father in 1966. He has lately reduced the company's dependence on the auto industry by moving into making components for sectors such as aerospace and oil and gas.  The tycoon's bet on the defense sector is taking shape: he has collaborated with Israel Aerospace Industries to make air defnse systems. Kalyani has also teamed up with Tata Motors and U.S.-based General Dynamics to bid on a $7.5 billion project to build infantry combat vehicles for the Indian army. He owns football team Bharat FC.
