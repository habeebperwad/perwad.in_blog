			Jonathan Gray started at asset manager Blackstone Group fresh out of college in 1992 and rose to the head of the firm's vaunted real estate group. He's also part of the succession plan for founder and chairman Steve Schwarzman.  His 4% stake in Blackstone accounts for the vast majority of his fortune. As global head of real estate, Gray has expanded his division into Blackstone's largest. Gray orchestrated Blackstone's $26 billion acquisition of Hilton in 2007, which the company says is the most profitable private equity deal of all time, having created a gain of more than $13 billion for Blackstone and its investors. In October 2015, he closed on what was reportedly the largest private real estate fund, raising a record-breaking $15.8 billion for the firm's Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII. Gray has given more than $30 million to alma mater UPenn to start a treatment and prevention center focused on the BRCA gene mutation, which can cause breast and ovarian cancers.
