			Mining tycoon German Larrea and his family own just under half of Grupo Mexico, the country's largest mining and infrastructure company. It has three main units: Americas Mining Corporation, which owns mining assets in Mexico, Peru (Southern Copper) and the U. S. (Asarco); Infraestructura y Transportes México (ITM), which owns two railroads. It also owns a 16% stake in Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, which operates airports, mainly on Mexico's west coast. In August 2014, the mining company faced scrutiny after a toxic spill at its largest copper mine, located in the northern Mexican state of Sonora, contaminated two rivers nearby. The company agreed with a government request to deposit $150 million in a trust to compensate local residents harmed by the spill.
