			Forty-year-old tattooed entrepreneur Jack Dorsey has been running two tech heavyweights: Twitter and Square. At Twitter, cofounder Dorsey is back as CEO after the departure of Dick Costolo in June 2015. Since taking back the reigns, Dorsey fired 8% of Twitter's staff and promised a third of his shares to the remaining employees.  Dorsey is also heading payments company Square, which he cofounded in 2009; Square went public in November 2015 at a stock price well below its latest $6 billion private valuation. A self-taught computer coder, Dorsey dropped out of New York University in 1999, became a certified masseur and dabbled in fashion design before gravitating fully to tech. In 2006, with Ev Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass, he cofounded Twitter and was the company's chief executive until 2008.
