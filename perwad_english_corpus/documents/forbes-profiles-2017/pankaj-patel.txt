			Indian pharma magnate Pankaj Patel runs listed company Cadila Healthcare, which was cofounded by his late father in 1952 as Cadila Laboratories to make vitamins. Patel, a pharmacy grad who joined the firm in 1976, took charge two decades ago after a formal separation between the two founding families.  The $1.5 billion (revenues) firm is among India's top five generic makers, headquartered in the Western Indian city of Ahmedabad. In a bid to expand in the U.S. market, Cadila recently agreed to buy speciality pharma firm Sentynl Therapeutics for $171 million. Third-generation scion, Sharvil, Pankaj's son, has been working at Cadila since 2007 and chairs Zydus, maker of popular sugar-substitute Sugar Free. Patel is also chairman of the Indian Institute of Management-Udaipur.
