			Leon Cooperman, a Wall Street legend, is currently going through a difficult time. In September 2016 the Securities & Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and his Omega Advisors hedge fund firm with insider trading.  Cooperman claims the charges are without merit, however, they've caused outside investors to flee. The majority of Omega consists of Cooperman's personal capital. The fight for his reputation aside, 2016 was strong year for Cooperman as his credit and equity funds rose roughly 10%. Cooperman is also becoming a media mogul, after rescuing National Enquirer-owner American Media, a cash cow that's rumored to be trying to buy Time Inc.
