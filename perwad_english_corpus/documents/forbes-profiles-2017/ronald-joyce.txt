			Canada's "Doughnut King" Ronald Joyce cofounded Tim Hortons with former NHL player Tim Horton, then sold the company to Wendy's for $600 million in 1995. A classic rags-to-riches story, the Nova Scotia native grew up in a home with no plumbing or electricity and dropped out of high school to work.  His father died when he was three, leaving his mother to raise three children by herself. After serving in the Royal Canadian Navy, Joyce worked as a policeman in Hamilton, Ontario, before entering the food business by buying a Dairy Queen shop. Rejected by the ice cream franchise when he applied to open a second location, Joyce bought a Tim Hortons store instead after he spotted a for-sale sign in the window. He later formed a close friendship with the store's namesake, and opened up two more locations by 1967, becoming a full partner in the process. When Horton died in a car accident in 1974, Joyce bought his shares from his wife and took over as sole owner. He also founded the Tim Horton Children's Foundation shortly after, which provides camps for children from low-income families.
