			Jon Oringer started Shutterstock with $10,000 in 2003 and became New York's first tech billionaire 10 years later. He took the photo service public in 2012. The company started when Oringer noticed that email blasts of new products got more clicks when they included pictures, but stock photos were too expensive for advertisers to use.  So he bought a camera, took 30,000 pictures and started a website that sold pictures for cheap. When users started downloading his photos faster than he could upload them, he hired contributors to take more pictures. The site now has over 30 million photos, 40,000 contributors and 2013 revenues of $235.5 million. A serial entrepreneur, Oringer had come up with one of the world's first pop-up blockers as a computer science graduate student at Columbia U. Oringer, who has since fallen out of the billionaire ranks as the stock dropped, rents an apartment in the West Village of New York City and flies his own helicopter.
