			One of Canada's most prolific real estate investors, Marcel Adams founded his Iberville Developments in 1958. Today the company owns and manages nearly 8 million square feet and more than 100 properties including shopping centers, offices, industrial properties and residences.  Born in Romania in 1920 under the last name "Abramovich," Adams survived Holocaust labor camps during World War II before coming to Canada. He started working in the leather industry but began investing in local real estate by the mid 1950s. His son, Sylvan Adams, a "Giving Pledge" signatory who now lives in Israel, has since taken over the business. Though the family is immensely private, they made headlines in 2015 when whistleblowers revealed that they had more than $800 million secretly stashed in a Swiss bank account.
