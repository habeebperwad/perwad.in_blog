The group, which began in 1955 with the Donghwa deptartment store, has diversified into fashion, hospitality (Chosun hotels in partnership with Westin), food and beverage and other sectors.  Spun off as a public company in 1996, Shinsegae International imports and distributes approximately 30 premium brands, including Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Givenchy. It also manufactures and distributes its own fashion labels (VOV, G-Cut and Tomboy) and markets household and consumer goods under the brand name Jaju as well as the Vidi Vici cosmetics line. The majority of her wealth comes from E-Mart, which the chaebol took public in 2011 and is now the country's biggest discount-store chain.
