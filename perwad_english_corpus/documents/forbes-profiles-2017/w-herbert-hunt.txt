			William Herbert Hunt and his family run oil and and gas firm Petro-Hunt. The son of famous wildcatter H.L. Hunt, Herbert and his brother, Nelson Bunker Hunt, tried to corner the silver market in the late 1970s.  The pair reportedly acquired some 195 million ounces of silver, worth nearly $10 billion at the peak. When silver prices collapsed in 1980, the brothers went bankrupt and fell off The Forbes 400. Herbert stuck it out in the oil business and, in 2013, sold a chunk of his Bakken oilfield acreage to publicly-traded Halcon Resources for $1.5 billion in cash and stock. His half-brother, Ray Lee Hunt, runs a separate oil company, Hunt Oil. Their father had 15 children with three women, allegedly starting a family with a woman in Florida under a false name while still married to Herbert's mother in Texas.
