			Sergei Popov has cashed out of all his investments in recent years. He and former partner of billionaire Andrei Melnichenko made a fortune managing finance and industrial group MDM. The partners later created TMK, one of the world's largest oil and gas pipe manufacturers, with former billionaire Dmitry Pumpyansky.   They sold out to Pumpyansky in 2006. That was also the year that the partners started to divide up their assets, a process that wasn't complete until 2012.  After the split, Popov kept MDM Bank, which had $5 billion in assets. In 2015, he sold it to BIN Group -- controlled by billionaires Mikhail Gutseriev, Sait-Salam Gutseriev and Mikhail Shishkhanov -- for $100 million. These days he focuses on the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, of which he is a founding member, and his charitable activity.
