			Martin Selig escaped Nazi Germany with his family when he was three years old, starting them on a long trek of hiding and passing through Germany and Poland before Moscow, where they snuck onto the Trans Siberian Railroad.  It let them off in Korea, where they found a place in steerage on a trans-pacific steamer going to San Francisco. It stopped in Seattle one day, unplanned, and his father told them they were getting off. Martin has been in Seattle ever since, and he's now one of the biggest property developers there. He jokes about why he got into real estate: "I didn't trust the stock market." He started off building shopping malls, and now has 4 million square of properties across the city, and another 1.5 million under development, including a big historic project turning the city's former federal reserve building into a glassy office high rise. The developer is also a painter and enjoys bicycling, riding his Harley motorcycle and skiing ("I skied 42 days last year. This year, I'm going for 50," he says). Married with three children, one daughter is in the family business, while another daughter is a producer with two films that debuted in 2015 at the Venice Film Festival, where Martin accompanied her.
