			Anne Beaufour and brother Henri's fortunes come from their stake in Ipsen, France's second-largest pharmaceutical company. Founded in 1929 by their grandfather, Henri Beaufour, the family's 76% share of Ipsen was split between three siblings when father Albert Beaufour died in 2000. Sister Veronica sold her 6% stake; Anne and Henri now control 57% of Ipsen, which reported 2015 revenues of $1.6 billion.  Anne sits on its board; she holds a bachelor's degree in geology from the University of Paris Orsay.
