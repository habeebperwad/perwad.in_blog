			Julio Ponce Lerou, a former son-in-law of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, derives his fortune from his stake in Sociedad de Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM), a publicly-traded chemicals and mining company that was privatized by Pinochet's government in the 1980s.  For almost 40 years Ponce headed SQM, one of the world's largest producers of potassium nitrate, iodine and lithium -- chemicals used in fertilizers and LCD screens -- but he resigned as chairman in April 2015, citing personal reasons.
