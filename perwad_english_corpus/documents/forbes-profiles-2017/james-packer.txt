			James Packer's fortune is derived from Crown Resorts, which owns casinos in Australia and London. The company has announced plans to quit its Macau gambling investment and a casino project in Los Angeles.  Packer spends little time in his hometown of Sydney; he's focused on Los Angeles, where his children live and his film company, Ratpac Entertainment, is based, and in Israel, where he has invested in technology ventures. Over recent years his fortune has dropped as he and sister Gretel have split the family empire inherited from their father, Kerry Packer, who died in 2005.
