			Ev Williams has cofounded three digital publishing companies: Blogger, Twitter and Medium. A University of Nebraska dropout, Williams grew up working on his family's soybean and corn farm, learned to write computer code and ultimately created blogging platform Blogger with two friends.  They sold it to Google in 2003. After spending two years working for Google, he left to join the crew that built Twitter, which he ran from 2008 to 2010. He still sits on Twitter's board and owns just over 6% of the company's stock. Williams is now focused on Medium, the online publishing platform he founded in 2012 with Biz Stone, a fellow Twitter cofounder.
