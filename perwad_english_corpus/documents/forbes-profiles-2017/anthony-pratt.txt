			Anthony Pratt bet $75,000 in 2016 on the Australian equivalent of OTB that Donald Trump would become president. When not busy making bets on the American political system, Pratt is busy disproving the theory that the third generation squanders family fortunes.  The Pratts' wealth, underpinned by the Visy packaging and recycling businesses in Australasia and the U.S., has grown substantially since he took over in 2009. His grandfather Leon started the business in 1948 and his late father Richard hugely expanded it. Anthony runs the operations in the U.S., where Pratt Industries is the biggest manufacturer of corrugated cardboard. He also heads up Visy, now Australia's biggest private company. His partner Claudine Revere sits on Visy's board . Sisters Heloise Waislitz and Fiona Geminder have stakes in Visy; the sisters are also billionaires.
