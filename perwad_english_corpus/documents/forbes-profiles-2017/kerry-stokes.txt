			Kerry Stokes had a blockbuster 2016; shares of his Seven Group Holdings more than doubled, sending the media mogul back onto the Forbes Billionaires list in 2017; he had dropped off the year before. Stokes took a winding path en route to earning a fortune with Seven, which has substantial media, construction and mining assets.  Early in his life, his mother gave him up for adoption, and he later dropped out of school at age 14. He started his career selling Caterpillar tractors and trucks in Australia and eventually China, before moving into media with Seven Group. He now also holds investments in cattle ranching and oil production. Stokes employs a team of people to manage his vast collection of paintings, sculptures and historic artifacts, many of which are on loan to art galleries around the world.
