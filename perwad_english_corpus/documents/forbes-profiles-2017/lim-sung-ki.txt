			Lim Sung-Ki is founder and chairman of Korea's largest drugmaker, Hanmi Science Co. In 1966, after obtaining a pharmacy degree from Chung-Ang University, he opened a pharmacy in Seoul bearing his name and expanded seven years later by launching Hanmi Pharmaceutical Industry Co. , whose first product was an oral antibacterial power. Hanmi Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Hanmi Science, had a blockbuster year in 2015, clinching agreements worth over $7 billion to license drugs to global pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi and Janssen. In early 2016, Hanmi Science announced that Lim would give personal shares worth around $90 million to the company's 2,800 employees as a bonus. The amount was determined based on each employee receiving the equivalent of 1,000% of his or her monthly pay.
