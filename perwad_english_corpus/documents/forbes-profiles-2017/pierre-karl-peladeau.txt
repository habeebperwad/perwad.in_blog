			The largest shareholder in Quebecor, a media conglomerate that owns such titles as Le Journal de Montréal, Pierre Karl Peladeau spent 14 years as CEO before stepping down in 2013. The next year he  successfully ran for office, but his foray into politics was short-lived: He resigned his post as leader of the separatist Parti Québécois in May 2016 and rejoined Quebecor in February.  Shares rose 70% while Péladeau was away from the CEO's desk.
