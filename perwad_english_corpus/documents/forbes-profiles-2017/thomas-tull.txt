			Thomas Tull is the founder of film production company Legendary Entertainment. His biggest hits have come from backing and co-producing the Dark Knight trilogy, the Hangover series, and 'Godzilla.' In January 2016, Tull sold the company to Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin's Wanda Group for $3.5 billion.  Tull stepped down as CEO of Legendary a year later to concentrate on his Tull Investment Group, which funds life science, media and technology companies such as Magic Leap, Pinterest, Heal and Zoox. Tull was born to a single mother in Binghamton, New York and grew up poor. After attending Hamilton College on a football scholarship, he started a chain of laundries and then purchased a string of tax-prep businesses before going into private equity. He raised $500 million from Wall Street and headed to Hollywood in 2005 to finance films. A sports fan, Tull has a minority stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, owns an extensive collection of baseball memorabilia and is a backer of Derek Jeter's Players' Tribune site.
