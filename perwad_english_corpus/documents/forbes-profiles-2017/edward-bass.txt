			With his three brothers, Edward Bass inherited a small fortune from their oil tycoon uncle Sid Richardson (d. 1959) and built it into a big one. They finally sold their oil interests in early 2017 to ExxonMobil for $6 billion.  They'd already been diversifying since the 1960s. Arguably Fort Worth's biggest booster, Ed Bass has led the drive to revitalize the Texas city, focusing on its downtown Sundance Square and $65 million Bass Performance Hall, which opened in 1998. Now under construction is a new $450 million arena -- with half its cost being borne by Bass and other donors. Once called "a Texas-bred cross between Prince Charles and Lorenzo de Medici," Ed is the Renaissance man among the Bass brothers and was once the money behind Biosphere 2. He also owns ranches in Texas and Flint Hills of Kansas where he is devoted to seeding with native grasses. Waxing philosophical during a press conference for Sundance Square, he once said, "Wealth is not, you know, a matter of money. It is a matter of being able to forwardly organize our lives in a positive way."
