			Trading legend Julian Robertson has helped launch some of the most successful careers in the hedge fund industry. He joined Kidder Peabody as a stockbroker in 1957 after serving in the Navy and founded Tiger Management in 1980, pioneering the then-budding hedge fund industry.  Since he returned money to investors in 2000, he has been managing his own book and seeding several hedge funds started by his disciples, dubbed Tiger Cubs. He built a chunk of his personal wealth in overseas markets, investing in golf resorts and vineyards in New Zealand along the way. His charity, the Tiger Foundation, has provided more than $150 million in grants in New York City aimed at fighting poverty through education, employment, youth & families and criminal justice.
