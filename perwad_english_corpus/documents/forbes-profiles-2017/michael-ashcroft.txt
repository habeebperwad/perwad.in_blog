			A Conservative party deputy chairman from 2005 to 2010, Michael Ashcroft stepped down from the House of Lords in March 2015. Half a year later, he released "Call Me Dave", an unauthorized biography of British Prime Minister David Cameron.  The scathing book included a series of uncorroborated allegations, including drug use and snobby behaviors -- and that the Oxford grad once stuck his private parts into the mouth of a dead pig as a part of an initiation ritual. Ashcroft admitted his disappointment that Cameron did not tap him for a high-ranking post, but insisted the book was not revenge. The businessman's fortune comes from starting and selling numerous companies, including home security giant ADT, which Tyco International bought for $6.7 billion in 1997. Proceeds from that sale still represent the bulk of his wealth.
