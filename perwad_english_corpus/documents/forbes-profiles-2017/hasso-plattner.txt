			Hasso Plattner and four colleagues left IBM in 1972 to launch German software company SAP, which went public in 1988. He has served as chairman of the supervisory board since May 2003, when he stepped down as CEO.  SAP has over 80,000 employees worldwide and generates annual revenue in excess of $23 billion. Passionate about promoting scientific and technological research, innovation and entrepreneurship, Plattner founded the Hasso Plattner Institute for IT Systems Engineering at the University of Potsdam in 1998. He also has a business incubator and venture capital fund, Hasso Plattner Ventures, to support young entrepreneurs in the IT sector, and a foundation that has made contributions to institutions in South Africa to support medical research on HIV/AIDS and promote healthcare and health education. In 2013, he signed The Giving Pledge, committing to give at least half of his fortune to philanthropic causes either during his lifetime or in his will. An art collector and sports enthusiast, Plattner sails competitively on his yacht, Morning Glory. Also an avid golfer (along with his wife, Sabine), Plattner owns Fancourt Golf Estate, a luxury development in South Africa's Western Cape province, a region where he likes to spend time. In the U.S., Plattner is the majority owner of the San Jose Sharks ice hockey team, which lost the 2016 Stanley Cup championship to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
