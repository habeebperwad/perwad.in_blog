			Press-shy Canadian billionaire Robert Miller co-founded Future Electronics in 1968. Eight years later, he bought out his partner for $500,000; now the Quebec-based company is one of the world's largest electronics distributors, with more than $5 billion in annual sales across 42 countries.  He rarely grants interviews or attends public ceremonies, and does not allow his picture to be taken. Miller believes in cryonics, the science of freezing bodies to restore life later on, and supports the cryonics-focused Alcor Life Extension Foundation.
