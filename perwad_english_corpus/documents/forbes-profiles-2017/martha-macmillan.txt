			When Cargill MacMillan Jr. died in 2011, his daughter, Martha MacMillan, inherited an estimated 2% stake in food giant Cargill Inc. Her great-great-grandfather founded the company in 1865, and 14 of his descendants are billionaires today.  Martha MacMillan does not have an active role in the company, which sells food, processes crops, trades commodities, sources ingredients and offers financial risk management. Her uncle Whitney MacMillan was the last family member to serve as CEO. Like the rest of her billionaire relatives, MacMillan lives a very private life. "They want to draw the curtain down," Cargill CEO David MacLennan told Forbes in 2014. "A lot of rich people want to be on TV, want you to know who they are and that they own this and that. Not these people."
