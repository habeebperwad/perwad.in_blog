			Indian IT pioneer Shiv Nadar cofounded HCL as a garage startup in 1976 to make microprocessors. Today, he chairs HCL Technologies, a $6.6 billion (revenues) company that is among the country's top software services providers.  Like its rivals, HCL has been on acquisition streak. Last year, HCL agreed to acquire Mumbai software firm Geometric, controlled by the billionaire Godrej family, in a share swap valued at $190 million. More recently, it bought Butler America Aerospace, a defence and aerospace services firm, for $85 million. His eponymous Nadar University is partnering with Dell for technology projects in areas such as cloud computing and big data.
