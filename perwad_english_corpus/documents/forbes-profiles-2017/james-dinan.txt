			James Dinan founded and runs hedge fund York Capital Management. He lost much of his savings in the 1987 stock market crash, but launched York in 1991 with some $4 million raised from colleagues from his onetime employer, investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.  York now oversees about $17 billion in assets. In 2014 Dinan purchased a minority stake in the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, partnering with fellow financial investors Marc Lasry and Wes Edens. He sits on numerous boards, including the board of directors of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the board of trustees of the Museum of the City of New York, which he chairs.
