			Ukraine's wealthiest man for eight years running, Rinat Akhmetov owns three-quarters of Metinvest Group, Ukraine's largest private company, which reported rising profits as iron ore and metals markets improved.  His real estate arm opened a high-end mall in late 2016.  But escalating violence in eastern Ukraine is intruding: Two Metinvest subsidiaries stopped production in February. There were also recent reports that pro-Russian separatists had seized 40 companies in the region, where Metinvest and DTEK , Akhmetov's energy company, have operations. Son of a coal miner, he got his start buying up mining assets in Ukraine's 1990s privatization.  He's been president of soccer club FC Shakhtar Donetsk since 1996 during privatization in the 1990s.  Today these form the basis of his SCM holding company.
