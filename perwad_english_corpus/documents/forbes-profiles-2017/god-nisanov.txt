			In 2016 God Nisanov and his partner, billionaire Zarakh Iliev, bought land in the center of Moscow, not far from the Kremlin, where they plan to build hotels. The partners own nearly 14 million of square feet of real estate in Moscow including a 225-acre wholesale distribution center, Food City, that they developed to look like such cities as Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Mexico City.   The partners also own several shopping centers on Moscow's outskirts. Their minority business partner, Ilkham Ragimov, graduated from Leningrad State University in the same class as President Vladimir Putin. Azerbaijan native Nisanov, with Iliev, opened Moscow's Moskvarium, said to be Europe's biggest aquarium, with 8,000 sea creatures and seven pools where visitors can swim with dolphins, in 2015.
