			David Walentas sees potential in forgotten neighborhoods. His current project is the Domino Sugar Factory on Brooklyn's Williamsburg waterfront, where he is planning to spend $3 billion, including debt, to transform the 11-acre space into a neighborhood with 2,800 apartments, office space, retail and a 6-acre public park.  His company, Two Trees, purchased the site for $185.5 million in 2012 and started demolition in 2014. It broke ground on the project's first building, a residential tower with 550 apartments, last year. It is set to open in July 2017.  Walentas made a fortune reimagining another Brooklyn neighborhood: In the late 1970s, with help from investors, he paid $12 million for 2 million square feet of old industrial buildings down under the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, an area now called Dumbo. Walentas grew up poor in Rochester, New York, milking cows and shoveling manure at a farm.
