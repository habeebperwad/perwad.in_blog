			With just $2,500, William R. Berkley founded insurance firm W.R. Berkley Corp. in 1967 while he was still an MBA student at Harvard. The $7.2 billion (sales) company does business through 44 operating units that insure everything from airports to jewels and fine art.  Berkley took the company public in 1974 and revenues surpassed the $1 billion mark in 1995 after nearly two decades of acquisitions. He still owns about 20% of the business and remains its executive chairman. His son, W. Robert Berkley, is president and CEO.
