			Donald Newhouse and his brother Samuel "Si" Newhouse--heirs to the multimillion-dollar publishing and broadcasting empire Advance Publications--took over for their father Sam upon his death in 1979. Si, who became chairman emeritus in 2015, ran the glossy magazines of its Conde Nast unit.  Donald has overseen the newspaper business that his father built up from a single daily, The Staten Island Advance, and is president of Advance Publications. Newspapers it owns include the Newark Star-Ledger, the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Like the industry at large, however, profits, circulation, and ad revenues have been declining in recent years, prompting Advance to cut print editions and focus on a controversial "digital-first" strategy directed by Donald's son, Steven. In addition, the company owns social news site Reddit and a substantial stake in Discovery Communications. In a deal that closed in April 2016, the Newhouse brothers sold cable TV company Bright House Networks to John Malone's Charter Communications for $11.4 billion in cash and stock.
