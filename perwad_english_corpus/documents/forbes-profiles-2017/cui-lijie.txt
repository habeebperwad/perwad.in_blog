			Cui Lijie, a long-time property investor in China and a jewelry collector, bought 75% of Hong Kong-listed First Natural Foods, now Imperial Pacific International Holdings, for $39 million in 2013. The company, linked to Macau junket promoter Hengsheng Group, then won the casino license in Saipan, a U. S. territory in the Pacific. In 2015 it opened a 40-table, 100-gaming machine casino in a shopping mall--phase one of a stratospheric $7.1 billion development plan betting on Chinese tourists. Son, Ji Xiao Bo, is the project director.
