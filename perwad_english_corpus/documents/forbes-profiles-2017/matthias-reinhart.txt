			Matthias Reinhart is majority shareholder of VZ Holding Ltd., a Swiss financial services company he took public in 2007. After getting his MBA at University of St. Gallen, he worked at McKinsey & Co. in Zurich and Chicago before co-founding (with Max Bolanz) VZ in 1993. Their key proposition: to bring transparency to a market that made it hard for customers to compare the prices and benefits of insurance and financial products.  VZ has tapped into latent demand for independent financial advice by opting not to broker any financial products; instead, customers pay a fee for advisory and portfolio-management services. Its investment philosophy, relying on rule-based models implemented mainly via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), aims to steer clients away from being guided by emotions. For medium and large-sized enterprises, VZ offers a benefit solution that combines pension fund schemes and employee insurance offerings into a single package, thus reducing administrative overhead. All of which has enabled VZ to shake-up a hidebound industry, while keeping investors in its own stock happy. Assets under management now exceed $17 billion.
