			David Tepper, arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation, has been steadily returning money to client investors of his Appaloosa Management. The hedge fund firm now manages some $17 billion.  Its funds posted returns in the middle single digits in 2016. He is now based in Miami Beach instead of northern New Jersey. Tepper has continued to support several philanthropic efforts, including a $67 million gift to Carnegie Mellon University to sponsor the David Tepper Quadrangle, a new building aiming to create a collaborative learning environment.
