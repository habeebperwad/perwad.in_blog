			Hortensia Herrero owns 28% of Mercadona, the recession-defying Spanish supermarket chain that she helped build with her billionaire husband Juan Roig and his siblings. Herrero, who serves as vice president, was part of the original group that bought the company from Roig's father back in 1981, when it was a chain of just eight small stores.  She met Roig at the University of Valencia, where both studied economics. Today Mercadona does $22.6 billion in revenue and has 1,614 locations across Spain, employing 76,000 people. Herrero has poured $8.6 million into restoring historic Valencia, Spain, the Mediterranean city where she and Roig met and still live today.
