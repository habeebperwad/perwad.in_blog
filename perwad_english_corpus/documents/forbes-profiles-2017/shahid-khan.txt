			Shahid Khan arrived in the United States from Pakistan at age 16 with just $500 in his pocket. He enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and started working as a dishwasher at nights.  He's come a long way since then. An engineer by trade, Khan's revolutionary design for a one-piece truck bumper was the basis for his success. His privately-owned autoparts maker, Flex-N-Gate, posted nearly $6 billion in sales in 2016. It has 62 plants in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, China and Spain and 13,000 employees. Khan also owns the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars, which he bought in 2012, and the Fulham football club, which he bought in 2013. Khan's 300-foot superyacht, 6 years in the making, was delivered at the end of 2014.
