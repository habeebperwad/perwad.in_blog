			Son of a Fujian farmer, Sam Goi is known as Singapore's 'Popiah King'. His privately held Tee Yih Jia Food Manufacturing is the world's largest maker of popiah skins that are used for spring rolls. Goi dropped out of school to work in his father's grocery store then got into frozen foods when he bought a struggling food unit.  In recent years, he has been striking real estate deals in Singapore and Malaysia via Singapore listed GSH Corp, in which he holds a 48% stake. In February, he made a splash with the $512 million sale of GSH Plaza, a 28-story office tower in the Raffle Place business district, to a Chinese buyer. Goi collects French antiques and Chinese artworks.
