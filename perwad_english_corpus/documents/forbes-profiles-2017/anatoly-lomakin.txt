			Anatoly Lomakin became a Yedinaya Rossiya party deputy in Russia's State Duma in 2012 but stepped down less than a year later, citing health problems. The only law that he voted for during his time in the Duma was one prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by U. S. citizens. 
During the Soviet period, Lomakin worked in an organization that exported Russian raw goods and materials. In 1992 he started the International Potassium Company (MMK), persuading three of the largest post-Soviet producers of fertilizer--Silvinit--Uralkali and Byelaruskali--to unite. But several years later the alliance broke up over an inability to agree on sharing their reserves. In 2005, MMK began exporting only Silvinit's production, and after Silvinit merged with Uralkali in 2011, MMK lost its potash contracts. Now it does consulting. Today Lomakin owns 50% of Investstoy, a company that invests in housing and residential property development in the Kaliningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, Saint Petersburg and Moscow regions.
