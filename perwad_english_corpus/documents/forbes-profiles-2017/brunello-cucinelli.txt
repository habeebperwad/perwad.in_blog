			The "king of cashmere," designer Brunello Cucinelli dropped out of engineering school and used a $550 bank loan to launch a fashion line in 1978. His eponymous luxury brand is known for its cashmere sweaters, but also sells dresses, suits, shoes, handbags and accessories.  In 1985 Cucinelli moved the headquarters of Brunello Cucinelli SpA to Solomeo, a medieval Italian hamlet that he has renovated, restoring its 14th-century castle and adding an amphitheater, school, public garden and sports complex. He espouses a theory of "humanistic capitalism" in which he aims to both share his company's profits and "humanize" his 1,500 employees. Cucinelli does not allow work after 5:30 pm and serves 90-minute homemade lunches prepared by the housewives of Solomeo.
