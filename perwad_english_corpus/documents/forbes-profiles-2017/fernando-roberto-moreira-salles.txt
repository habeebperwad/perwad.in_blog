His late father, Walther Moreira Salles, was the founder of Unibanco and a former ambassador to the United States. In 2008 Unibanco merged with Itau, then Brazil's second-largest commercial bank, creating Itau-Unibanco, the largest bank in Latin America today.  The Moreira Salles family owns a controlling stake in the bank. Moreira Salles' three half-brothers are also all billionaires, and they all own a majority stake in Cia. Brasileira de Metalurgia & Mineracao (CBMM), the world's leading supplier of niobium, which is used to produce stronger, lighter steel for industrial pipes and aircraft parts. Moreira Salles also owns a stake in the company that controls Brazil's largest book publisher.
