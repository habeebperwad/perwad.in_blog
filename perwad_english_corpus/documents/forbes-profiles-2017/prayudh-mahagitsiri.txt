			Thailand's coffee king, Prayudh Mahagitsiri's Quality Coffee Products is a joint venture with Nestl√©. With a 60% market share, it has been cashing in on the country's rising coffee culture, though the economic slowdown has crimped growth.  He also has interests in steel, copper, shipping, offshore drilling and property development. His daughter Ausanee runs the Krispy Kreme franchise in the country. Son Chalermchai, a Boston University grad, is CEO of holding outfit PM Group. Mahagitsiri recently acquired the Pizza Hut franchise in Thailand through his shipping unit.
