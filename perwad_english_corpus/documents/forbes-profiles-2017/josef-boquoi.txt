			Frozen-food king Josef Boquoi joined his father's small coffee- and grain-roasting business in 1953, after receiving a business degree and completing an apprenticeship in Hamburg. He proceeded to introduce new items, including ice creams, and developed a business model based on freezing and packaging a wide variety of fresh food, and delivering direct to households.  His first refrigerated vans hit the streets of Germany in 1969. Today, bofrost, based in Straelen, has approximately 11,000 employees, four million customers and about $1.4 billion in revenue. It offers upwards of 1,000 different specialities in Europe, delivered by a fleet of 5,500 sales vehicles. Offerings are tailored to regional tastes, and so is the method of delivery. In Venice, for example, customer orders are brought by boat, while in Madrid small vehicles are deployed to be able to navigate through the narrowest of alleys. The company prides itself on using no artificial flavors, flavor enhancers, preservatives, colorings or irradiated ingredients. Boquoi has three children and reportedly likes to play tennis in his free time. He is extremely private and never grants interviews.
