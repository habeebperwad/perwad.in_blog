			Torbjorn Tornqvist is the Swedish co-founder of Gunvor Group, one of the largest commodities conglomerates in the world. The massive oil trader benefits from an increasingly diverse presence with refineries, pipelines, terminals and mining operations in 35 countries.  Tornqvist got his start at British Petroleum in 1977. After later stints at Scandinavian Trading Co. and Intermaritime Group Petrotrade, he formed Gunvor's predecessor company in Estonia in 1997 to export Russian crude oil. Three years later he founded Gunvor with Russian billionaire, Gennady Timchenko. In 2014, one day before the US Treasury imposed sanctions against Timchenko over Russia's annextion of Crimea, Tornqvist bought out the Russian oligarch. Tornqvist now owns 60% of Gunvor, and the rest is owned by company employees.
