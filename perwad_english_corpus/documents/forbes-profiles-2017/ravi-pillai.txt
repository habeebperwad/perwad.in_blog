			Indian-born farmer's son, Ravi Pillai migrated to the Gulf after his small construction business in his native Kerala state went bust due to a workers' strike. With help from a well-connected local partner who put in capital, he started over in 1979 and eventually built his RP Group of Companies into a $5.3 billion (revenue) construction heavyweight riding the Middle East boom.   Among the biggest employers of Indians in the Middle East, last year he pledged to employ 3,000 Indians from the thousands who had lost their jobs in Saudi Arabia due to an economic slowdown. The construction magnate has used his Gulf riches to invest back home, picking up stakes in banks, hotels, real estate.
