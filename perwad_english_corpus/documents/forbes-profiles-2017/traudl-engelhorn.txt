			Traudl Engelhorn belongs to a storied German industrial clan whose patriarch, Friedrich Engelhorn, founded the chemical company BASF in 1865. She is the widow of Peter Engelhorn, whose brother Curt ran the family business Boehringer Mannheim for more than three decades -- expanding its biochemical and pharmaceutical operations while also transforming it into one of the world's leading makers of medical diagnostic tests.  In 1997, through a tax-advantaged Bermuda holding company, he initiated the sale of the company to Roche for $11 billion. As part of the deal, finalized in 1998, Roche also acquired Boehringer's interest in DePuy, a leading manufacturer of artificial joints and orthopedic products. Owning a 22.3% stake in the family holding company, Corange Ltd., Traudl netted approximately $2.45 billion. Now about 89 years old, she lives a quiet life in Lausanne, Switzerland and avoids publicity. Together with her deceased husband, Traudl built up one of Europe's biggest collections of contemporary glass art. Works are exhibited in Lausanne, Switzerland and Mannheim, Germany.
