			Perhaps best known as Trump's permanently tanned pal, Stewart Rahr has an office in Trump Tower, an apartment in a Trump building on the Upper East Side and an odd habit of calling himself "Stewie Rah Rah No.  1 King of All Fun." He sold Kinray, the drug wholesaler his father founded, to Cardinal Health in 2010 for $1.3 billion in cash. He gave $250 million to his ex-wife in 2013 after the couple divorced. He has been conservatively investing the rest since. He's also amassed a substantial art collection, including pieces by Pablo Picasso, Damien Hirst and Andy Warhol.
