			Patriarch Rahul Bajaj, who chairs the 91-year-old Bajaj Group, saw his wealth increase by $1.1 billion, partly from the rising shares of financial services arm Bajaj Finserv, which is overseen by his younger son Sanjiv.  The group's two-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto suffered a drop in sales due to the cash crunch brought on by demonetisation of the rupee. Older son Rajiv, who runs the company, called the government's move " a wrong idea". He also complained that while Bajaj's quadricycle Qute is being exported, it has still to get approval to sell in India.
