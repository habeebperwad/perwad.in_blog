			Thailand's healthcare magnate and former surgeon Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth founded Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, Thailand's largest private hospital operator with  a network of 41 hospitals in Thailand and 2 in Cambodia.  The company has lately benefited from rising medical tourism and the country's ageing population. To attract more overseas patients, Bangkok Dusit plans to spend $370 million on a new luxury healthcare complex in Bangkok that will include a five-star hotel. He also owns regional airline, Bangkok Airways, which he took public in 2014. PPTV, his digital TV channel, has the rights to broadcast matches of the English Premier League.
