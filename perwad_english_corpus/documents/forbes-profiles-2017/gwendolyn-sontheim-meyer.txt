			Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer inherited an estimated 7% stake in food giant Cargill, the largest private company in America. The heiress is not active in the company's operations and instead spends most of her time on a farm in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. , training horses that compete in show jumping. Her great-grandfather, W.W. Cargill, the son of a Scottish sea captain, founded Cargill in Conover, Iowa in 1865. Unlike most families who got rich in the Gilded Age, the Cargills have held onto nearly full ownership of their company for the last 150 years. W.W. passed it down to his son-in-law, John MacMillan, in 1909. The family is no longer involved in management; the last relative to serve as CEO was Whitney Macmillan, who retired in 1995.
