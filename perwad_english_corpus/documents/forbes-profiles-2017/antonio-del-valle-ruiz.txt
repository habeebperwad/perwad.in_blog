			Antonio del Valle Ruiz got his start in banking, surviving nationalization in the early 1980s and the peso's collapse in the mid 1990s. In 2002 he sold his minority stake in Mexican banking group Grupo Financiero Bital to his partners in exchange for the control of industrial group Camesa, which later became chemical and pipe-making conglomerate Mexichem, of which he and his six children own 42%. In 2015, Del Valle and his business partner Carlos Slim took public their construction conglomerate, Elementia, on the Mexican stock exchange.  In 2003 Del Valle and other investors founded Grupo Financiero BX+, also known as Banco Ve Por Mas. He and his family own a 35% stake in the banking venture. He also owns stakes in chemical distributor Grupo Pochteca and Spanish bank Popular Espa√±ol. He serves as honorary chairman of a number of his companies while leaving daily operations to his children.
