			The Novosibirsk State University graduate started out in 1993 selling a variety of consumer goods to a hungry public. He later founded the Profit House investment firm and registered it in the remote Russian region of Kalmykia, then a domestic tax haven.  In 2003 he and partners bought five Russian generic-drug plants and a drugstore chain from ICN Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. company founded by former Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic. These assets grew to what is now known as Pharmstandard, one of the biggest makers of pharmaceuticals in Russia.  Kharitonin and Egor Kulkov, who together bought out their partners' stakes, led a buyout of then-publicly listed Pharmastandard in 2016. He also has an investment in OTCpharma, which trades on the Moscow Stock Exchange.
