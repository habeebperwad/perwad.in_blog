			Veteran media mogul Stanley Hubbard helms Hubbard Broadcasting, which owns 13 TV stations, 41 radio stations and Reelz, a cable network with 70 million subscribers. His dad founded the first commercial TV station in Minnesota; he also bought the first TV camera ever sold, in 1938. Hubbard followed in his footsteps, working as a photojournalist before moving into management of the family business.  The former University of Minnesota hockey player still skates with his grandkids, and four of his five children head his empire's various subsidiaries. "The secret to success," he says, "is to have kids who are smarter than you."
