			Drew Houston is CEO of Dropbox, a file sharing service he cofounded in 2007, when he was 24, with MIT classmate Arash Ferdowsi. The company was valued at $10 billion in January 2014 after it raised more than $1.1 billion from venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and others.  In early 2017, Houston announced that Dropbox was on track to reach $1 billion in annual revenues. The service boasts 500 million users and has been shifting its focus from consumer to business applications. Several mutual funds have written down the value of their investments in Dropbox, reportedly reflecting declines in value among publicly-traded competitors and the fact that Dropbox hasn't raised money in nearly two years. FORBES has lowered its estimate of the company's value to $8 billion; Houston owns an estimated 13% stake. Houston (pronounced like the New York City street, not the Texas city) has reportedly explored taking the company public as early as sometime in 2017. He started playing around on computers when he was very young and got involved in startups during high school.
