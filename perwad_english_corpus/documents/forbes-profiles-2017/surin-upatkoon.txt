			The bulk of Surin Upatkoon's fortune comes from the cash that he got after selling a 10% stake in Thai telecom company InTouch in 2013. Upatkoon, who is a Thai national, also has interests in gaming company Magnum Corp. , which contributes to about a fifth of his fortune. He also owns a stake in textile company MWE. He started his career as a manager at MWE Weaving in 1971, went on to become managing director and now owns a third of the company. He got his biggest break when he participated in the acquisition of a major stake in Multi-Purpose Holdings, which he later split into MPHB Capital, an insurance and real estate outfit. In October 2016 he resigned as managing director of MPHB Capital to allow for a clear separation between a substantial shareholder and management. He's lived in Malaysia since 1965, when he arrived in Penang for high school and stayed to work.
