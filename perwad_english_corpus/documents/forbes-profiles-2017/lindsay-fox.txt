			Trucking magnate Lindsay Fox owns Linfox, Australia's biggest privately held logistics company with more than 5,000 trucks across 10 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Fox quit his school for academically gifted boys at age 16 to become a truck driver like his father.  He bought his first truck at 19. Though he is no longer involved in day-to-day operations, leaving management to his sons Peter, who is executive chairman, and Andrew, who runs the property division, the business continues to expand with new contracts with Thailand's Yum! and paint company Dulux. The company also owns currency-management outfit Armaguard; an extensive industrial property portfolio, overseen by Andrew; a half-share in a business park; and an ailing airport. Fox, whose nickname is "Snake Eyes," also owns the historic Melbourne amusement part, Luna Park; more than 100 vintage cars are on display for the public; a race track; and four homes, including one in Hawaii. He had a massive two-week party cruising the Mediterranean in August 2016 with 100 or so friends, ahead of his 80th birthday in April 2017.
