			John Bloor, a billionaire home builder and motorcycle manufacturer, works hard to stay off the radar. But reports suggest he took an unlikely path en route to earning his riches. Bloor reportedly left school at age 15 and began an apprenticeship as a plasterer; he built his first house before turning 20. Today Bloor Homes is one of the largest privately held builders in the U.  K., constructing about 3,000 houses each year. Bloor bought the manufacturing rights to his other major asset, Triumph Motorcycles, In 1983, and has been pouring money into R&D ever since. Now run by his son, Nick, Triumph has boasted legendary riders like Marlon Brando in 'The Wild One', James Dean in 'Rebel Without A Cause', and Steve McQueen in 'The Great Escape'.
