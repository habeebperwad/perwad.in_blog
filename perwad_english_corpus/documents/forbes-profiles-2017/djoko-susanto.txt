			Djoko Susanto, the sixth of 10 siblings, built a retail group from humble beginnings. He never finished high school. At age 17 he started managing his parents' modest food stall inside a traditional market in Jakarta.  He added cigarettes to the lineup and began opening more stalls. His success attracted the attention of clove cigarette tycoon Putera Sampoerna. Together they opened similar stalls and then a discount supermarket chain. When Putera sold his cigarette business to Altria subsidiary Phillip Morris in 2005, Susanto bought the retail business and developed it into Alfa Supermarket. His Alfamart, a minimart format, has expanded to the Philippines. His Alfa Group is also active in residential real estate development. His children now run the business.
