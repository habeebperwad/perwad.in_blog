			Roberto Ongpin, the chairman of property developer of Alphaland and former Philippine trade minister, has been embroiled in controversy. The Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission accused Ongpin of insider trading in connection with the 2009 sale of Philex Mining shares.  Ongpin denied the charges. The Court of Appeals effectively issued a hold on a July 2016 SEC ruling requiring him to pay a fine and disqualifying him from serving as officer or director of a corporation. Ongpin resigned as head of gaming firm PhilWeb Corp. in 2016 after being among the oligarchs singled out by President Rodrigo Duterte as "embedded in government."
