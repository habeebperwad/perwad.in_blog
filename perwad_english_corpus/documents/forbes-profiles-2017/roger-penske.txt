			Roger Penske has come a long way since his early days as a professional race car driver. After retiring from the sport Penske entered the business world, buying his first car dealership in 1965 with a $75,000 loan from his father.  Today, that investment has morphed into the Penske Automotive Group, a publicly traded company with nearly $20 billion in annual revenue. Combined, Penske's businesses bring in over $26 billion per year and employ upwards of 50,000 people. His corporate empire includes a fleet of car dealerships, a multinational truck leasing goliath and a Utah ski resort. Outside of the boardroom, the automotive titan serves as the active owner of Team Penske, a highly successful professional racing team.
