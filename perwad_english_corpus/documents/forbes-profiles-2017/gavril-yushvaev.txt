			Gavril Yushvaev has gotten rich betting on a wide assortment of businesses. In the early 90s he cofounded Trinity, which owned car dealerships, one of Moscow's first casinos and Moscow dance club Metelitsa.  He later invested in dairy and juice company Wimm-Bill-Dann, which went public in 2002. The prospectus revealed that Yushvaev had served nine years in a Soviet prison camp after being found guilty of a "violent crime" in 1980.  Yushvaev sold his 19.6% stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann to Pepsico for $1.1 billion in 2010. Three years later, he and billionaire Zelimkhan Mutsoev bought billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov's 38% stake in gold producer Polyus Gold for $3.6 billion, and then sold his stake in 2015.  He has also partnered with Vladislav Doronin, an ex-boyfriend of supermodel Naomi Campbell, investing $300 million in a 4.3-million-square-foot Moscow real estate development that will include an 85-story tower, a boutique hotel, offices, a multiplex and parking for 3,900 cars.
