			John Gandel owns half of the southern hemisphere's largest shopping mall, Chadstone, with more than 500 stores in eastern Melbourne. He also has a big stake in listed property trust Vicinity Centres, which owns the other half of Chadstone, plus other malls and outlets.  Gandel says the key to his success was the deregulation of shopping hours and shopping becoming a leisure activity. He first got rich by expanding his Polish immigrant parents' women's clothing chain, Sussan, now owned by his niece, Naomi Milgrom. But his real wealth came from the shopping malls he bought from Myer department stores for $37 million in the 1980s. Today Gandel maintains one of Australia's largest philanthropic funds.
