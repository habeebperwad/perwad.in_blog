			In 2007, Bulat Utemuratov received an estimated $785 million when Italian bank UniCredit purchased 91.8% of Kazakhstan's ATF Bank for $2.1 billion. He used the proceeds to fund private equity investments through Verny Capital.  Utemuratov and Verny parlayed an investment in gold producer Vasilkovsky GOK (now Altyntau Resources) into shares of mineral producer Kazzinc. In 2012 and 2013, Glencore plc and the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund purchased those Kazzinc shares for over $1.8 billion. More recently, Utemuratov has invested $400 million in Kazakhstan's ForteBank and diversified into real estate. The portfolio is held through Verny and includes Ritz-Carlton hotels in Moscow and Vienna, plus Talan Towers, a $350 million complex in the Kazakh capital of Astana. Verny also plans to open a Ritz-Carlton in Astana.
