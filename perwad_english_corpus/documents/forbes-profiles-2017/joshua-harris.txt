			Josh Harris knows how to time an investment. His Philadelphia 76ers have had a losing record every year since 2013, including an abysmal 10-72 finish to the 2015-2016 season. Still, the team's value has risen to $800 million since he and a group of investors bought it for roughly $290 million in 2011, and may soar even higher after securing Ben Simmons as the 2016 number one draft pick.  Harris is hoping for similar returns on his stakes in the NHL's New Jersey Devils, which he acquired in 2013, and the English Premier League's Crystal Palace Football Club, which he picked up in late 2015. Harris' very lucrative daytime job is senior managing director of Apollo Global Management, the buyout firm he co-founded in 1990 with Leon Black and Mark Rowan. The trio started the private equity mega-fund after their previous employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, collapsed in scandal. The son of an orthodontist, Harris attended the University of Pennsylvania and got his MBA at Harvard. He is a former wrestler and still competes in marathons and triathlons.
