			Yeung Kin-man and his wife, Lam Wai Ying, owe their billions to their glass screen maker Biel Crystal. The couple owns the entire company and supplies screens for two-thirds of iPhones worldwide. They built Biel into one of the world's largest makers of glass screens for cellphones, tablets, watches and optical devices.  Besides Apple, it supplies Samsung and Sony. Born and raised in Hong Kong, Yeung started producing watch crystals in the city in 1986 and opened Biel's first mainland site, in Shenzhen, two years later. Finding that the plastic screen of his cellphone scratched easily, Yeung tried using glass instead. The company secured Motorola as its first major customer in 2003 and shifted its focus to cellphone screens. Today it has a second mainland location, in Huizhou, Guangdong, and employs more than 100,000 people on the mainland.
