			In early 2017 Lee Bass and his three brothers sold their oil company, originally inherited from tycoon uncle Sid Richardson (d. 1959) to ExxonMobil for $6 billion. A devoted outdoorsman, Lee has been instrumental in protecting rhinoceroses worldwide, and is responsible for bringing critically endangered black rhinos and white rhinos to the Fort Worth Zoo.  Lee spent 12 years as commissioner of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. His El Coyote ranch in south Texas is home to an elite herd of Texas longhorn cattle. In 1991 Lee donated $20 million to alma mater Yale for a new program in Western Civilization. After outcry against Lee's insistence that he get to approve the program's professors, Yale canceled the program and returned the donation. The Lee & Ramona Bass Foundation is endowed with more than $50 million.
