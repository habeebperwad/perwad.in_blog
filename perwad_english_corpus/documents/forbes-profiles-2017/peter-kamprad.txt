			Peter Kamprad, together with brothers Mathias and Jonas, inherited the fortune and responsibility previously held by their father, Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad, until 2013. Ingvar Kamprad was among the top-10 of the world's richest for five years thanks to Forbes' estimate of the global furniture giant, but his net worth took a drastic slide in 2011 after his lawyers produced documents proving that he had irrevocably transferred the majority of his stake in Ikea to entities beyond his economic control decades earlier.  The three brothers still own Ikano Group, which originally was created to manage Ikea's real estate, insurances and financial service businesses, but was spun off as a separate company in 1988. Today Ikano Group is a $7.3 billion (annual sales) company that operates across Europe and Asia with interests in banking, real estate and shopping centers. Peter, the eldest brother, ran Ikea's Belgian operations for 12 years;  he now chairs the Ikano Group.
