			One of seven children of a Liverpool shopkeeper, Tom Morris founded TJ Morris -- which owns discount retailer Home Bargains -- in 1976 when he was just 21. He reportedly used a bank overdraft to start the business.  Today there are more than 400 Home Bargains stores throughout the United Kingdom. The company stocks everything from health and beauty products to candy and kids' toys, often bought at a discount from brands trying to offload stock. It employs more than 17,000 people.
