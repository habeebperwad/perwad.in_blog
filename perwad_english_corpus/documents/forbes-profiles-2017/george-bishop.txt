			In late 2013 George Bishop notched one of the great scores of the oil boom when his GeoSouthern Energy sold its Eagle Ford shale fields to Devon Energy for $6 billion cash. After payouts to partners and investors like Blackstone, Bishop is believed to have cleared at least $1.5 billion from the deal.  In 2015 Bishop redeployed some of that cash, teaming with asset manager GSO Capital Partners to buy Encana's position in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana for $850 million. Bishop, who is very private, also owns the Eagleford Restaurant in Cuero, Texas and is a partner in the River Ridge Golf Club, west of Houston. In 2014 he reportedly bought the Chub Cay island resort in the Bahamas.
