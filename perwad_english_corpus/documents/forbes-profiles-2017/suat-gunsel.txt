			Suat Gunsel owns Northern Cyprus' largest educational institution, Yakin Dogu (Near East) University, in Lefkosa (Nicosia). The campus, serving around 20,000 students, occupies a prime piece of his extensive real estate portfolio, which includes properties in Turkey.  Gunsel is investing around $100 million to construct a 35,000 square meter factory to produce an electric car under the brand name Gunsel -- the result of eight years of research and development undertaken by Near East University. Due on the market in 2018, the car can accelerate to 100 km per hour in eight seconds and go for 350 km on a full battery. The Yakin Dogu campus, where the factory is being built, already boasts the largest mosque in Cyprus, built at a cost of $30 million. In 2013 Gunsel opened Girne University (also known as Kyrenia) on the coast of northern Cyprus, specializing in navigation, aviation and nautical studies. He also has investments in the banking and hospital sectors. His collection of around 60 classic cars is housed in an automobile museum on the Yakin Dogu campus.
