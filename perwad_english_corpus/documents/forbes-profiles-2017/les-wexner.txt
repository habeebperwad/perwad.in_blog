			Victoria's Secret boss Les Wexner oversees a global retail empire that reached $12 billion in sales in 2015. After more than 50 years running the company, he isn't resting yet. Fearing that Victoria's Secret was stalling out in early 2016, he announced plans to shut down the company's famous catalog and hired the former CEO of Spanx to be one of his top lieutenants.  Wexner founded The Limited with a $5,000 loan from his aunt in 1963 and bought Victoria's Secret for $1 million in 1982, when it was just a small, failing chain of lingerie shops in San Francisco. Today the brand is a global powerhouse, with a fashion show that draws a larger audience than all other fashion shows combined. He still lives in Columbus and is deeply committed to his hometown. But he also likes to get out and see the world as well, often on his 300-foot yacht named, appropriately, Limitless.
