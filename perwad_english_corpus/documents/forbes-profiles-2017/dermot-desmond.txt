			Dermot Desmond started his career in finance at Citibank, and later worked for the Investment Bank of Ireland and PricewaterhouseCoopers before founding NCB Stockbrokers in 1981. It eventually became Ireland's largest independent brokerage.  He sold it for $39 million in 1994. With the proceeds, Desmond started his own private equity firm, International Investment & Underwriting, which now has stakes in travel software firm Datalex, Mountain Province Diamonds, Barchester Healthcare and Glasgow soccer club Celtic PLC. In 2015 he made headlines attempting to block the merger of British gambling companies Gala Coral and Ladbrokes, of which he is reportedly a 2.8% owner. His demands were ultimately overridden by a shareholder vote. An avid golfer, he's known as "The Kaiser" for his distinctive mustache.
