			Viatcheslav Kantor heads publicly traded Acron, one of Russia's largest fertilizer producers. He graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute and set up a computer trading company in the late 1980s. He later received a contract to carry out an environmental impact assessment at the Azot chemical plant in Novgorod.  That plant was later renamed Acron and privatized in 1993. Kantor owns an extensive collection of art by Russian Jewish artists, worth an estimated $500 million. Kantor also owns Moscow Stud Farm #1, which has about 2900 acres of land near Moscow. Chair of the European Jewish Congress, Kantor founded the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a non-governmental organization that fights xenophobia, extremism and anti-Semitism and monitors European countries' adherence to the principles of tolerance. Kantor is also the founder and president of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, a non-governmental organization that brings together experts on nuclear non-proliferation.
