			India's cola king, Ravi Jaipuria, presides over $1.1 billion (revenue) drinks and foods group RJ Corp. In October he took his flagship Varun Beverages, PepsiCo's second-biggest bottler, public but the shares are down 10% since the IPO on concerns over the company's debt.  Fast-food outfit Devyani International has 500 retail outlets for brands such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Costa Coffee and TWG Tea. Jaipuria also owns a minority stake in health care firm Medanta. His father got the bottling franchise for Coca Cola in the 1960s. The youngest of three brothers, he studied in the US and returned home in 1985. After a family division in 1987, in which he got one bottling plant as his share, he switched to PepsiCo and has stayed loyal since.
