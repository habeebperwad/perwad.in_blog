			Kenny Troutt founded long-distance phone company Excel Communications in 1988. A bartender's son, he began his career selling life insurance and used the funds to pay for his tuition at Southern Illinois University.  Troutt took Excel public in 1996 and, two years later, merged it with Teleglobe in a $3.5 billion deal. He reinvested the profits in stocks, bonds and horses. He sponsors his two sons' nationally competitive youth basketball teams, which integrate disadvantaged families with middle and upper-class ones. Troutt also enjoys horse racing and owns WinStar Farm in Versailles, Ky., which houses anywhere from 300-500 horses, including the 2016 Belmont Stakes winner Creator.
