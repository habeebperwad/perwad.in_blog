			Brothers Tung Chee Hwa and Tung Chee Chen control nearly 70% of shipping giant Orient Overseas. Chee Chen, also a billionaire, remains chairman and CEO after elder brother Chee Hwa stepped down in 1997 to serve as Hong Kong's first chief executive.  Founded by their father nearly 70 years ago, the company today counts more than 270 offices in 60 countries. Chee Hwa's sons, Alan and Andrew, are both executives there.
