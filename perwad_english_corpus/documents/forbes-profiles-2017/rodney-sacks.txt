			Rodney Sacks is one half of the billionaire duo running Monster Beverage, which makes an energy drink that competes with Red Bull and Rockstar Energy. Sacks is Monster's longtime chairman and chief executive, while Hilton Schlosberg is the vice-chairman, CFO and COO.  The two South African natives started running the company together in 1990, and have made lots of acquisitions along the way. Among the most significant was the 1992 purchase of soda maker Hansen's Natural, back when it was small-time operation. In 2002, the company introduced its marquee product, Monster Energy; ten years later, the business changed its name from Hansen Natural Corp. to Monster Beverage. In August 2014 Coca-Cola bought a 16.7% stake in Monster and agreed to partner on its energy drink business.
