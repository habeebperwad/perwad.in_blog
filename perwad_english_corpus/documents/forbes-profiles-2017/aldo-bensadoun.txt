			Aldo Bensadoun is the founder and executive chairman of retailer ALDO, best known for its footwear and accessories. The son of a shoe merchant and grandson of a cobbler, he was born in Morocco and spent most of his childhood in France.  He moved to Montreal for college and in 1972 opened ALDO as a concession within a chain of popular fashion boutiques. That same year, Mr. B, as he is nicknamed, introduced an Italian clog that became a massive bestseller. The first freestanding ALDO store opened in Montreal in 1978. A nonfamily CEO has been running the business for the past three years, seeking fresh footing by raising prices, trimming shoe offerings and pruning the number of North American stores.
