			Martua Sitorus is cofounder and executive deputy chairman of agribusiness giant Wilmar International. In September 2016, Wilmar and Archer Daniels Midland received approval from regulators to move forward with Olenex, their oil-processing and marketing joint venture.  In 2015 Sitorus teamed up with the Indonesian billionaires Rudi and Michael Hartono,  Australian-based private equity firm EMR Capital and U.S. hedge fund firm Farallon Capital Management to buy Agincourt Resources, which operates a gold and silver mine. His property arm Gamaland owns Gama Tower, currently the tallest building in Indonesia. A former economics student, he traded shrimp as a teenager and then switched to palm oil. He bought his first plantation in 1994 and later cofounded Wilmar with the nephew of Malaysia's richest man, Robert Kuok. He helped merge Wilmar with the senior Kuok's plantation and agribusiness group in 2007, turning Wilmar into one of the world's largest palm oil producers; it's also one of the largest cooking oil producers in Asia.
