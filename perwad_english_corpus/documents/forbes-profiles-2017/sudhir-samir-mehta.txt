			Brothers Sudhir & Samir Mehta get the bulk of their wealth from listed pharma outfit Torrent Pharmaceuticals, a 58-year-old company founded in the Western Indian city of Ahmedabad by their late father, who started out as a pharma salesman with Sandoz.  He set up what became Torrent Pharma in 1959 by marketing anti-rheumatic medicines. Today, the firm gets 40% of its $1 billion revenue from the U.S. and about a third from India. Their Torrent Power, overseen by older brother Sudhir, distributes electricity to more than 3 million customers in their home state of Gujarat, plus Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.
