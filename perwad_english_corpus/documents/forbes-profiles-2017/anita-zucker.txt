			Anita Zucker is CEO of the Charleston-based InterTech Group, a holding company with a wide range of assets, including a chemical production plant, an aerospace engineering firm and large amounts of commercial real estate.  Zucker's late-husband, Jerry, founded the business with a partner in 1982, when they purchased a single industrial manufacturing plant owned by Raybestos-Manhattan. Within five years the small operation had grown into a multinational conglomerate, and Zucker quickly began compiling assets across the globe. By the time Jerry died of a brain tumor in 2008, he had amassed over 300 individual patents. The company and the family fortune were then left to Anita and the couple's son, Jonathan. Today Anita is the owner of the South Carolina Stingrays, a minor league hockey team. She continues to be highly active in the Charleston business community.
