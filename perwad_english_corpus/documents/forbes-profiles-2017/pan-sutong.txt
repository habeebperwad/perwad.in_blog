			Polo-loving property baron Pan Sutong watched his net worth plunge in 2016 by $8.1 billion, or two-thirds. Investors continued to flee his Goldin Financial after its shares suffered a dramatic boom and bust in 2015. Pan has said he suspects that short-sellers have been feasting on the shares.  He teamed up with a Chinese distressed-asset firm to inject cash into his premier project, a gargantuan real estate development in the Chinese city of Tianjin, centered on a 117-story skyscraper. The self-made Pan also has assets in consumer electronics and wine.
