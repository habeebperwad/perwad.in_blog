			A series of smart acquisitions has transformed David Teoh's TPG Telecom from a computer retailer into a major internet service provider in Australia. His latest purchase was a nearly $1.2 billion takeover of rival iiNet in 2015. Today Teoh, who is executive chairman, owns more than a third of the company with his wife, Vicky, who helped him get started but is no longer involved.  Vicky and their four sons have launched more than a dozen startups in clothing, accessories, furniture, consumer technology, men's shoes and eyeglasses. They've also started a property investment company. Famously publicity-shy, Teoh, who emigrated from Malaysia in 1986, managed to avoid all media photographers until one staked out his Sydney home for three days in 2015.
