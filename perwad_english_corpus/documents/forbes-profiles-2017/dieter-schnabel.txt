			By its own account, Helm AG began in 1900 as a Hamburg-based import-export business "for merchandise of every description." Dieter Schnabel's father, Hermann, took over from the namesake founder, Karl O.  Helm, in 1950, and set a path focused on chemicals. By 1967 subsidiaries in Scandinavia, Mexico and Japan had been established. After succeeding his father as chairman of the executive board in 1984, Dieter Schnabel continued the overseas expansion while transforming the company from primarily a trader of bulk products like menthol into a more diversified, science- and marketing-driven organization with international partners and its own proprietary, branded products. One of the world's leading independent chemical marketing firms, with annual revenue of around $9 billion and offices in 30 countries, Helm is active in generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, human and animal nutrition, fertilizer and crop protection, organic and inorganic chemicals, and disposable medical products (catheters, surgical sutures, injection devices, etc.). Dieter inherited the company when Hermann died in 2010, and stepped down from the executive board to become head of the supervisory board in 2012. His oldest son, Stephan, who heads the Crop Protection business unit, represents the third family generation to serve on the executive board. Dieter reportedly enjoys golf and kayaking.
