			Jane Goldman is America's only female billionaire running a real estate firm. She co-chairs and heads up day-to-day operations at Solil Management, which she owns equally with her three siblings. The youngest daughter of the late Sol Goldman, who was at one time New York's biggest landlord, she oversees a huge portfolio that includes at least at least 400 New York City properties including high-end apartments on the Upper East Side, the block of land in Midtown Manhattan that includes the Olympic Tower and the Cartier Mansion, and the landmark Peninsula Hotel.  Jane and her siblings also own a 17% stake in three buildings in the World Trade Center development in lower Manhattan. Her brother Allan is co-chair but has taken a back seat recently. Her sisters Amy and Diane Kemper are senior advisers. Jane's son, Michael, and Allan's son, Steven, are heirs apparent. The New York City resident reportedly paid $31 million for Palm Beach estate originally owned by the Kennedys.
