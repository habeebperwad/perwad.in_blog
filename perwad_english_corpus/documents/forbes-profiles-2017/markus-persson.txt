			Markus "Notch" Persson made his fortune selling the rights to his game Minecraft to Microsoft in 2014. He's been since jetting around the world while programming new games in his spare time. An avid social media user Persson has also been open about the downsides of instant success as he used Twitter and Reddit to express the loneliness and emptiness followed by extreme richness.  The main con about being rich, he told Reddit users, was the lack of external motivation to ever finish any projects. Persson created Minecraft as a hobby project, and release the boxy designed game in indie-game forums, while employed as a developer at Candy Crush maker King Entertainment. The immediate popularity of the game led Persson to leave King and form Mojang in 2010, selling 1 million copies in January 2011 and 10 million just six months later. The three million dollars Persson earned in dividends that year was split between the 25 employees of Mojang. In September 2014, after selling 15 million copies of Minecraft across gaming consoles, a $2.5 billion cash deal with Microsoft catapulted Persson to billionaire ranks. Known online as "Notch," Persson has been a vocal critic of big corporations, leading to three million Twitter followers and a cult-status.
